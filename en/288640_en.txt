The '''National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps''' ('''NOAA Corps''') is a federal uniformed service operating under the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), which is a scientific agency under the [[United States Department of Commerce]]. The NOAA Corps is one of the seven [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]] of the [[United States]], having approximately 300 [[commissioned officer]]s.

==History==

The NOAA Commissioned Corps, established in 1917 as the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, and then as the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA) Corps from 1965-1970, traces its roots back to the former [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]], which dates to 1807 under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]].  Coast and Geodetic Survey [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] were commissioned so that under the [[laws of war]], they could not be executed as [[Espionage|spies]] if they were serving as [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]s on a battlefield.

The NOAA Corps today provides a cadre of professionals trained in [[engineering]], [[earth science]]s, [[oceanography]], [[meteorology]], [[fisheries science]], and other related disciplines. Officers operate ships, fly aircraft, manage research projects, conduct diving operations, and serve in staff positions throughout NOAA.

==Commissioned officers==
The NOAA Corps uses the same commissioned officer [[military rank|ranks]] as the United States [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]].  While the rank of [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] has been authorized for use by the NOAA Corps, no officer in its history has held that rank.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/37/usc_sec_37_00000201----000-.html] 10 USC 201. Pay grades: assignment to; general rules</ref>  The rank of [[Vice Admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] exists but requires congressional approval for re-activation; the only officer to hold that rank was [[Henry Arnold Karo|H. Arnold Karo]] in 1965.  Current NOAA Corps ranks rise from [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]], [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|pay grades]] O-1 through O-8 respectively.  NOAA Corps officers are appointed via direct commission and receive the same [[United States Military Pay|pay]] as other members of the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]].  They can not hold a dual commission with another service but inter-service transfers are permitted.

==Uniforms==
For formal service uniforms, the NOAA Corps wears the same [[Uniforms_of_the_United_States_Navy#Service_Dress|Service Dress Blues]] and Service Dress Whites as the [[United States Navy|Navy]], but with NOAA Corps insignia in place of Navy insignia.  For daily work uniforms, the NOAA Corps wears the same [[Operational Dress Uniform]] (ODU) as the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], but with NOAA Corps insignia in place of Coast Guard insignia.
