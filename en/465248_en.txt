The '''culture of Turkey''' combines a largely diverse and [[heterogeneous]] set of elements that are derived from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Europe]]an and [[Middle East]]ern traditions. This rich diversity is mostly owed to [[Names of the Ottoman Empire#Historic maps using the alternative names of the Ottoman Empire|Turkey]]'s former status as a [[Ottoman Empire|multiethnic empire]] which, [[de facto]] until the loss of [[Libya]] to the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1912 (and [[de jure]] until the official loss of [[List of monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty#Ottoman Khedivate (1867–1914)|Egypt and Sudan]] to the [[British Empire]] in 1914, as a consequence of the Ottoman government's decision to join the [[First World War]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]]) spanned three continents: [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. The present-day [[Republic of Turkey]], which [[Treaty of Lausanne|succeeded]] the Ottoman State in 1923, is still a [[transcontinental]] country that spans Europe and Asia.

The nation was [[Atatürk's Reforms|modernized]] primarily by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] starting from 1923. As he transformed a [[religion]]-driven former Ottoman Empire into a modern [[nation-state]] with a strong [[secularism|separation of state and religion]], a corresponding increase in the methods of artistic expression arose. During the first years of the republic, the government invested a large amount of resources into fine arts such as paintings, sculpture and architecture. This was done as both a process of modernization and of creating a cultural identity. Because of the different historical factors defining the Turkish identity, the culture of [[Turkey]] combines clear efforts to be "modern" and [[Western culture|Western]], with a desire to maintain traditional religious and historical values.

The question "Who are the Turks?" does not have an easy answer. At the turn of the 20th century the Ottoman Empire was a multinational state extending over three continents. This page limits its discussion to the borders of the Republic of Turkey (founded in 1923). The location of the pictures are given with the name of the city or as a region, in case the source does not mention it.

Turkish culture has undergone profound changes over the last century. Today, Turkey may be the only country that contains every extreme of Eastern and Western culture (along with many compromises and fusions between the two). The Ottoman system was a multi-ethnic state that enabled people within it not to mix with each other and thereby retain separate ethnic and religious identities within the empire (albeit with a dominant Turkish and Southern European ruling class). Upon the fall of the empire after [[World War I]] the Turkish Republic adapted a unitary approach, which forced all the different cultures within its borders to mix with each other with the aim of producing "Turkish" national and cultural identity. This mixing, instead of producing cultural homogenization, instead resulted in many shades of grey as the traditional Muslim cultures of Anatolia collided with (or had imposed upon them) the cosmopolitan modernity of Istanbul and the wider West. Thus, Turkish culture in many ways represents a continuum that bridges past and present.

The music of Turkey includes elements of [[Central Asian]] folk music, [[Arabic music|Arabic]], [[Persian music|Persian classical music]], ancient [[Greco-Roman]] music and modern [[Europe]]an and [[United States|American]] popular music. Turkey, rich in musical heritage, has developed this art in two areas, Turkish classical music (similar to Greco- Roman) and Turkish folk music (Similar to Central Asian). The biggest Turkish pop star of the 20th century was probably [[Sezen Aksu]], known for overseeing the Turkish contribution to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and was known for her light pop music.
European [[european classical music|classical]] composers in the 18th century were fascinated by Turkish music, particularly the strong role given to the [[brass instrument|brass]] and [[percussion instrument]]s in  Ottoman [[Janissary]] bands called [[Mehter]] who were the first marching military band in History. [[Joseph Haydn]] wrote his ''Military Symphony'' to include Turkish instruments, as well as some of his operas. Turkish instruments were also included in [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony Number 9]]''. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] wrote the "Ronda alla turca" in his ''[[Piano Sonata, K. 331 (Mozart)|Sonata in A major]]'' and also used Turkish themes in his operas.  Although this Turkish influence was a fad, it introduced the [[cymbal]]s, [[bass drum]], and [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s into the symphony orchestra, where they remain.

[[Jazz]] musician [[Dave Brubeck]] wrote his "Blue Rondo á la Turk" as a tribute to Mozart and Turkish music.

Turkish [[pop music]] boasts numerous mainstream artists with wide followance since the 1960s like [[Ajda Pekkan]] and [[Sezen Aksu]], and younger pop stars like [[Candan Erçetin]],[[Sertab Erener]], [[Tarkan]] and [[Mustafa Sandal]]. [[Underground music]] and the genres of [[electronica]], [[hip-hop]], [[Rapping|rap]] and [[dance music]] saw an increased demand and activity following the 1990s.

Turkish rock music, sometimes referred to as [[Anatolian rock]], initiated during the 1960s by individuals like [[Cem Karaca]], [[Barış Manço]], and [[Erkin Koray]], has seen wide-range success and has grown a considerable fan base. A few of the more mainstream Turkish [[rock band]]s include [[Mor ve Ötesi]], [[Duman (band)|Duman]], and [[maNga]]. Individual rock performers like [[Şebnem Ferah]], [[Özlem Tekin]], and [[Teoman]] have substantial fan-bases. Turkey also boasts numerous large-scale rock festivals and events. Annually held rock festivals include [[Barışarock]], [[H2000 Music Festival]], [[Rock'n Coke]], and [[RockIstanbul]], during many of which internationally renowned bands / artists frequently take the stage together with Turkish artists.

In 2003, a Turkish singer [[Sertab Erener]] won the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with her song [[Everyway That I Can]].  she also won other awards

== Literature ==
{{main|Turkish literature}}
[[File:Kemalbey.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Namık Kemal]] was a prominent Turkish poet, novelist, playwright and journalist of the late Ottoman period]]
 
[[Turkish literature]] is the collection of written and oral texts composed in the [[Turkish language]], either in its [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman form]] or in less exclusively literary forms, such as that spoken in the Republic of Turkey today. Traditional examples for [[Turkish folk literature]] include the stories of [[Karagöz and Hacivat]], Keloğlan,  and [[Nasreddin Hoca]], as well as the works of folk poets such as [[Yunus Emre]] and [[Aşık Veysel]]. The ''Book of [[Dede Korkut]]'' and the [[Epic of Köroğlu]] have been the main elements of the Turkish epic tradition in Anatolia for several centuries. 

The two primary streams of [[Ottoman literature]] were [[poetry]] and [[prose]]. Of the two, the [[Poetry of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Divan poetry]], a highly [[ritual]]ized and [[Symbolism|symbolic]] art form, was the dominant stream. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either ''gazel''s or ''kasîde''s. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the ''mesnevî'', a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]. The tradition of [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] was exclusively [[non-fiction]]al in nature; as the [[fiction]] tradition was limited to narrative poetry. 
[[File:Orhan Pamuk3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Orhan Pamuk]] is one of the leading contemporary Turkish novelists and the winner of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]
The [[Tanzimat]] reforms of 1839–1876 brought changes to the language of Ottoman written literature, and introduced previously unknown Western genres, primarily the [[novel]] and the [[short story]]. Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Namik Kemal|Nâmık Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel ''İntibâh'' (Awakening), while the [[journalist]] Şinasi is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish [[Play (theatre)|play]], the [[One act play|one-act]] [[comedy]] "''Şair Evlenmesi''" (The Poet's Marriage). Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923. Broadly, there were three primary literary movements during this period: the ''Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde'' (New Literature) movement; the ''Fecr-i Âtî'' (Dawn of the Future) movement; and the ''Millî Edebiyyât'' (National Literature) movement. The ''Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde'' (New Literature) movement began with the founding in 1891 of the magazine ''Servet-i Fünûn'' (Scientific Wealth), which was largely devoted to progress (both intellectual and scientific) along the Western model. Accordingly, the magazine's literary ventures, under the direction of the poet [[Tevfik Fikret]], were geared towards creating a Western-style "[[High culture|high art]]" in Turkey. 

Stylistically, the early [[prose of the Republic of Turkey]] was essentially a continuation of the National Literature movement, with Realism and Naturalism predominating. This trend culminated in the 1932 novel ''Yaban'' (The Wilds) by [[Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu]]. This novel can be seen as the precursor to two trends that would soon develop: [[social realism]], and the "village novel" (''köy romanı''). The social realist movement was led by the short-story writer [[Sait Faik|Sait Faik Abasıyanık]]. The major writers of the "village novel" tradition were [[Kemal Tahir]], [[Orhan Kemal]], and [[Yaşar Kemal]]. In a very different tradition, but evincing a similar strong political viewpoint, was the [[Satire|satirical]] short-story writer [[Aziz Nesin]]. Other important novelists of this period were [[Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar|Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar]] and [[Oğuz Atay]]. [[Orhan Pamuk]], winner of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], is among the innovative novelists, whose works show the influence of postmodernism and magic realism. Important [[Poetry of the Republic of Turkey|poets of the Republic of Turkey period]] include [[Ahmet Haşim]], [[Yahya Kemal Beyatlı]] and [[Nazım Hikmet]] (who introduced the [[free verse]] style). [[Orhan Veli|Orhan Veli Kanık]], [[Melih Cevdet Anday]] and [[Oktay Rifat]] led the [[Garip]] movement; while Turgut Uyar, [[Edip Cansever]] and [[Cemal Süreya]] led the ''İkinci Yeni'' movement. Outside of the ''Garip'' and ''İkinci Yeni'' movements, a number of other significant poets such as [[Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca]], [[Behçet Necatigil]] and [[Can Yücel]] also flourished.

===Poetry===
{{main|Turkish poetry}}
[[File:Tevfik Fikret2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Tevfik Fikret]] (1867–1915), a prominent poet of the late Ottoman era]]
Poetry is the most dominant form of literature in modern Turkey. 

The '''folk poetry''' tradition in Turkish literature, as indicated above, was strongly influenced by the Islamic Sufi and Shi'a traditions. Furthermore, as partly evidenced by the prevalence of the still existent aşık/ozan tradition, the dominant element in Turkish folk poetry has always been song. The development of folk poetry in Turkish—which began to emerge in the 13th century with such important writers as Yunus Emre, Sultan Veled, and Şeyyâd Hamza—was given a great boost when, on 13 May 1277, Karamanoğlu Mehmet Bey declared Turkish the official state language of Anatolia's powerful Karamanid state;[4] subsequently, many of the tradition's greatest poets would continue to emerge from this region.

There are, broadly speaking, two traditions of Turkish folk poetry:

'''the aşık/ozan tradition,''' which—although much influenced by religion, as mentioned above—was for the most part a secular tradition; 
'''the explicitly religious tradition,''' which emerged from the gathering places (tekkes) of the Sufi religious orders and Shi'a groups. 
Much of the poetry and song of the aşık/ozan tradition, being almost exclusively oral until the 19th century, remains anonymous. There are, however, a few well-known aşıks from before that time whose names have survived together with their works: the aforementioned Köroğlu (16th century); Karacaoğlan (1606?–1689?), who may be the best-known of the pre-19th century aşıks; Dadaloğlu (1785?–1868?), who was one of the last of the great aşıks before the tradition began to dwindle somewhat in the late 19th century; and several others. The aşıks were essentially minstrels who travelled through Anatolia performing their songs on the bağlama, a mandolin-like instrument whose paired strings are considered to have a symbolic religious significance in Alevi/Bektashi culture. Despite the decline of the aşık/ozan tradition in the 19th century, it experienced a significant revival in the 20th century thanks to such outstanding figures as Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu (1894–1973), Aşık Mahzuni Şerif (1938–2002), Neşet Ertaş (1943– ), and many others.

'''Ottoman Divan poetry''' was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the Persian poetry that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير mura'ât-i nazîr / تناسب tenâsüb) and opposition (تضاد tezâd)—were more or less prescribed. Examples of prevalent symbols that, to some extent, oppose one another include, among others:

the nightingale (بلبل bülbül) — the rose (ﮔل gül) 
the world (جهان cihan; عالم ‘âlem) — the rosegarden (ﮔﻠﺴﺘﺎن gülistan; ﮔﻠﺸﻦ gülşen) 
the ascetic (زاهد zâhid) — the dervish (درويش derviş) 

In the early years of the Republic of Turkey, there were a number of poetic trends. Authors such as Ahmed Hâşim and Yahyâ Kemâl Beyatlı (1884–1958) continued to write important formal verse whose language was, to a great extent, a continuation of the late Ottoman tradition. By far the majority of the poetry of the time, however, was in the tradition of the folk-inspired "syllabist" movement (Beş Hececiler), which had emerged from the National Literature movement and which tended to express patriotic themes couched in the syllabic meter associated with Turkish folk poetry.

[[File:NazimHikmetRan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nazım Hikmet]] is the most famous Turkish poet abroad and one of the all-time greatest literary figures of the 20th century<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/2002/04/15poet|title=The tree with blue eyes|accessdate=2007-09-20|publisher=Le Monde diplomatique |first=John|last=Berger}}</ref>]]

The first radical step away from this trend was taken by Nâzım Hikmet Ran, who—during his time as a student in the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1924—was exposed to the modernist poetry of Vladimir Mayakovsky and others, which inspired him to start writing verse in a less formal style. 
Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the publication of a small volume of verse preceded by an essay and entitled Garip ("Strange"). The authors were Orhan Veli Kanık (1914–1950), Melih Cevdet Anday (1915–2002), and Oktay Rifat (1914–1988). Explicitly opposing themselves to everything that had gone in poetry before, they sought instead to create a popular art, "to explore the people's tastes, to determine them, and to make them reign supreme over art".[21] To this end, and inspired in part by contemporary French poets like Jacques Prévert, they employed not only a variant of the free verse introduced by Nâzım Hikmet, but also highly colloquial language, and wrote primarily about mundane daily subjects and the ordinary man on the street. The reaction was immediate and polarized: most of the academic establishment and older poets vilified them, while much of the Turkish population embraced them wholeheartedly.
Just as the Garip movement was a reaction against earlier poetry, so—in the 1950s and afterwards—was there a reaction against the Garip movement. The poets of this movement, soon known as İkinci Yeni ("Second New"[22]), opposed themselves to the social aspects prevalent in the poetry of Nâzım Hikmet and the Garip poets, and instead—partly inspired by the disruption of language in such Western movements as Dada and Surrealism—sought to create a more abstract poetry through the use of jarring and unexpected language, complex images, and the association of ideas. To some extent, the movement can be seen as bearing some of the characteristics of [[postmodern literature]]. The best-known poets writing in the "Second New" vein were Turgut Uyar (1927–1985), Edip Cansever (1928–1986), Cemal Süreya (1931–1990), Ece Ayhan (1931–2002), and İlhan Berk (1918– ).

Outside of the Garip and "Second New" movements also, a number of significant poets have flourished, such as Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca (1914– ), who wrote poems dealing with fundamental concepts like life, death, God, time, and the cosmos; Behçet Necatigil (1916–1979), whose somewhat allegorical poems explore the significance of middle-class daily life; Can Yücel (1926–1999), who—in addition to his own highly colloquial and varied poetry—was also a translator into Turkish of a variety of world literature; and İsmet Özel (1944– ), whose early poetry was highly leftist but whose poetry since the 1970s has shown a strong mystical and even Islamist influence.

===Prose===
{{main|Prose of the Republic of Turkey}}
The style of the current novelists can be traced back to the "Young Pens" (Genç Kalemler) journal in the Ottoman period. Young Pens was published in [[Selanik]] under [[Ömer Seyfettin]], [[Ziya Gökalp]] and Ali Canip Yöntem. They covered the social and political concepts of their time with the nationalistic perspective. They were the core of a movement which became known as the "national literature."

With the declaration of the Turkish Republic in 1923, Turkish literature became interested in folkloric styles. This was also the first time since the 19th century that Turkish literature was escaping from Western influence and began to mix Western forms with other forms. During the 1930s, [[Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu]] and Vedat Nedim Tor published ''Kadro'', which was revolutionary in its view of life.

[[Orhan Pamuk]] is a leading Turkish [[novelist]] of [[postmodernism|post-modern]] literature. His works have been translated into more than twenty languages. He is the recipient of major Turkish and international literary awards, such as the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

==Architecture==
{{Main|Turkish architecture}}

=== Early architecture (1299-1437) ===
==== Early Ottoman period (1299-1326) ====
[[File:Edirne 7325 Nevit.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Interior of an early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] mosque in [[Edirne]], [[Turkey]]]]
[[File:Blue mosque Istanbul 2007 Roof.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Interior of the [[Sultanahmet Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]]]
With the establishment of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the years 1300-1453 constitute the early or first Ottoman period in architecture, when Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. This period witnessed three types of mosques: tiered, single-domed and subline-angled mosques. The Hacı Özbek Mosque (1333) in [[İznik]], the first important center of Ottoman art, is the first example of an Ottoman single-domed mosque.

==== Bursa period (1326-1437) ====
The domed architectural style evolved from [[Bursa]] and [[Edirne]]. The ''Ulu Cami'' (Holy Mosque) in Bursa was the first [[Seljuk]] mosque to be converted into a domed one. Edirne (Adrianople) was the Ottoman capital between 1365 and 1453, when [[Istanbul]] (Constantinople) became the new capital, and it is here that we witness the final stages in the architectural development which culminated in the construction of the great mosques of Istanbul. The buildings constructed in Istanbul during the period between the Turkish conquest of the city in 1453 and the construction of the Istanbul [[Bayezid II Mosque]] are also considered works of the early period. Among these are the [[Fatih Mosque]] (1470), Mahmut Paşa Mosque, the tiled palace and [[Topkapı Palace]]. The Ottomans integrated mosques into the community and added soup kitchens, theological schools, hospitals, [[Hammam|Turkish baths]] and tombs.

=== Classical period (1437-1703) ===
[[File:Pałac Topkapi ze Złotego Rogu RB1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Topkapı Palace]], Istanbul.]]
During the classical period, mosque plans changed to include inner and outer courtyards. The inner courtyard and the mosque were inseparable. The master architect of the classical period, [[Mimar Sinan]], was born in 1492 in [[Kayseri]] and died in Istanbul in the year 1588. Sinan started a new era in world architecture, creating 334 buildings in various cities. Mimar Sinan's first important work was the [[Şehzade Mosque]], completed in 1548. His second significant work was the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] and the surrounding complex, built for [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The [[Selimiye Mosque (Edirne)|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]] was built during the years 1568-74, when Sinan was in his prime as an architect. The [[Rüstem Pasha Mosque]], Mihrimah Sultan Mosque, Ibrahim Pasha Mosque, and the [[Şehzade Mosque]], as well as the [[türbe]]s (mausoleum) of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], [[Roxelana]] and [[Selim II]] are among Sinan's most renowned works. Most classical period designs used the [[Byzantine architecture]] of the neighboring [[Balkans]] as its base, and from there, ethnic elements were added, creating a different architectural style.

Examples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, aside from Turkey, can also be seen in the [[Balkans]], [[Hungary]], [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Algiers]], where mosques, bridges, fountains and schools were built.

=== Westernization period (1703-1876) ===
[[File:John frederick lewis-reception1873.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A view from the interior of a traditional Turkish house, by [[John Frederick Lewis]] (1805-1875)]]

During the reign of [[Ahmed III]] (1703-1730) and under the impetus of his grand vizier İbrahim Paşa, a period of peace ensued. Due to the close relations between the Ottoman Empire and [[France]], Ottoman architecture began to be influenced by the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles that were popular in Europe. Interestingly, a style that was very similar to [[Baroque]] was developed by the [[Seljuk Turks]], according to a number of academics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoag|first=John D|title=Islamic architecture|year=1975 |publisher=Faber|isbn=0571148689|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Aslanapa|first=Oktay |title=Turkish art and architecture |year=1971 |publisher=Faber|isbn=0571087817|location=London}}</ref> Examples of the creation of this art form can be witnessed in the [[Divriği]] Hospital and Mosque, which is a [[UNESCO]] world heritage site, as well as in the [[Sivas]] Çifte Minare, [[Konya]] [[Ince Minaret Medrese|İnce Minare]] museums and many other buildings from the Seljuk period in [[Anatolia]]. It is often called the "Seljuk Baroque portal." From here it emerged again in Italy, and later grew in popularity among the Turks during the Ottoman era. Various visitors and envoys were sent to European cities, especially to [[Paris]], to experience the contemporary European customs and life. The decorative elements of the European Baroque and Rococo influenced even the religious Ottoman architecture. On the other hand, [[Mellin]], a French architect, was invited by a sister of Sultan Selim III to Istanbul and depicted the [[Bosporus]] shores and the seaside waterfront mansions called [[yalı]]. During a thirty-year period known as the [[Tulip period]], all eyes were turned to the West, and instead of monumental and classical works, villas and pavilions were built around Istanbul. However, it was about this time when the construction on the [[Ishak Pasha Palace]] (1685-1784) in Eastern Anatolia was going on.

==== Tulip period (1703-1757) ====
Beginning with this period, the upper class and the elites in the Ottoman empire started to use the open and public areas frequently. The traditional, introverted manner of the society began to change. Fountains and waterside residences such as the Aynalıkavak Kasrı became popular. A water canal (other name is Cetvel-i Sim) and a picnic area ([[Kağıthane]]) were established as recreational areas. Although the [[Tulip period]] ended with the [[Patrona Halil]] uprising, it became a model for attitudes of Westernization. During the years 1720-1890, Ottoman architecture deviated from the principles of classical times. With Ahmed III’s death, [[Mahmud I]] took the throne (1730-1754). It was during this period that Baroque-style mosques were starting to be constructed.

==== Baroque period (1757-1808) ====

Circular, wavy and curved lines are predominant in the structures of this period. Major examples are the Nur-u Osmaniye Mosque, [[Zeynep Sultan Mosque]], [[Laleli Mosque]], Fatih Tomb, Laleli Çukurçeşme Inn, Birgi Çakırağa Mansion, [[Aynalıkavak Palace]], and the [[Selimiye Barracks]]. Mimar Tahir was the important architect of this period.

==== Empire period (1808-1876) ====
[[File:DolmabahceMainGate.JPG|thumb|200px|One of the main entrance gates of the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]]]]
[[File:Waterfront houses on the Bosphorus.jpg|thumb|200px|Traditional waterfront houses, called [[yalı]], on the [[Bosporus]]]]
[[Nusretiye Mosque]], [[Ortaköy Mosque]], Sultan Mahmud's Tomb, Galata Lodge of the Mevlevi Dervishes, [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace]], [[Yalı|Sadullah Pasha Yalı]] and the [[Kuleli Military High School|Kuleli Barracks]] are the important examples of this style, developed parallel with the Westernization process. Architects from the [[Balyan family]] were the leading ones of the time. This period was marked by buildings of mixed Neo-Classical, Baroque, Rococo and Empire styles, such as the Dolmabahçe Palace, Dolmabahçe Mosque and Ortaköy Mosque.

=== Late Ottoman period (1876-1922) ===
[[Pertevniyal Valide Sultan Mosque]], Şeyh Zafir Group of Buildings, Haydarpaşa School of Medicine, Duyun-u Umumiye Building, Istanbul Title Deed Office, large Post Office buildings such as the Merkez Postane (Central Post Office) in Istanbul's Sirkeci district, and the Harikzedegan Apartments in Laleli are the important structures of this period when an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] style was dominant. [[Raimondo Tommaso D'Aronco]] and [[Alexander Vallaury]] were the leading architects of the time.

=== Republic of Turkey period (since 1923) ===
In this period, Turkish architects looked into the religious and classical buildings of former times for inspiration in their attempts to construct a national architecture. Nationalism, developing strongly after the second Ottoman constitutional period, freed Ottoman architecture from the influence of Western art, and thereby brought about a new style based on classical Ottoman architecture. The Central Post Office and Vakıf Han buildings of Mimar Kemalettin Bey in Sirkeci, Istanbul, are early examples of the first Turkish national architecture movement. Similar buildings were edificed in [[Ankara]], such as the Ziraat Bank Building, Türkiye İş Bankası building, and several Ministry buildings in the period of [[Atatürk]]'s presidency.

Following this development, the Ismet Paşa Girls' Institute building, the Ankara University Faculty of Literature building, the buildings of the Saraçoğlu district, the Grand Theater and the Istanbul Hilton Hotel paved the way for recognition of contemporary architecture. During this period, Sedad Hakkı Eldem built the Science and Literature faculty buildings of the Istanbul University, while Emin Onat designed [[Anıtkabir]] in [[Ankara]].

Today's Turkish architectural scene reflects a wide range of buildings, events, architectural and construction fairs and shows. Such nation-wide, highly-attended architectural events include the ''Turkey Build'' fair and the Yıldız Meetings. While Turkey Build draws building materials vendors to its 4-day activities every year, Yıldız Meetings keep bringing together the leaders of the Turkish architectural scene, as well as industrial and political leaders.

== Cuisine ==
{{Main|Turkish cuisine}}

[[Turkish cuisine]] inherited its [[Ottoman cuisine|Ottoman heritage]] which could be described as a fusion and refinement of [[Central Asian cuisine|Turkic]], [[Arab cuisine|Arabic]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]] and [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] cuisines.<ref>Nur Ilkin - A Taste of Turkish cuisine</ref> Turkish cuisine also influenced these cuisines and other neighbouring cuisines, as well as western European cuisines. Ottomans fused various culinary traditions of their realm with influences from [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines, along with traditional Turkic elements from Central Asia such as [[Yoghurt|yogurt]]. The Ottoman Empire indeed created a vast array of technical specialities. It can be observed that various regions of the Ottoman Empire contain bits and pieces of the vast Ottoman dishes. 
[[File:Turkishcoffee.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turkish coffee]]]]
[[File:TurkishDelightDisplay.jpg|thumb|[[Turkish Delight]]]]
Taken as a whole, Turkish cuisine is not homogenous. Aside from common Turkish specialities which can be found throughout the country, there are also region-specific specialities. The [[Black Sea]] region's cuisine (northern Turkey) is based on corn and anchovies. The southeast—[[Urfa]], [[Gaziantep]] and [[Adana]]—is famous for its [[kebab]]s, ''[[meze]]s'' and dough-based desserts such as ''[[baklava]]'', ''kadayıf'' and ''künefe''. Especially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees are grown abundantly, [[olive oil]] is the major type of oil used for cooking.<ref>[http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnicUS95cusine/turkey.htm Ethnic Cuisine - Turkey by Terrie Wright Chrones]</ref> The cuisines of the [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]], [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara]] and [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] regions display basic characteristics of [[Mediterranean cuisine]] as they are rich in vegetables, herbs and fish. Central Anatolia is famous for its pastry specialities such as ''[[keşkek]]'' (kashkak), ''[[mantı]]'' (especially of [[Kayseri]]) and ''[[gözleme]]''.  

The name of specialities sometimes includes the name of a city or a region (either in Turkey or outside). This suggests that a dish is a speciality of that area, or may refer to the specific technique or ingredients used in that area. For example, the difference between Urfa kebab and [[Adana Kebab|Adana kebab]] is the use of garlic instead of onion and the larger amount of hot pepper that kebab contains.
