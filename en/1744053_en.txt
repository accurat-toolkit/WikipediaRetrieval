'''George Tupou V''' ([[Tongan language|Tongan]]: '''Siaosi Tupou V''', full name: '''Siaosi Tāufa{{okina}}āhau Manumataongo Tuku{{okina}}aho Tupou V'''), (born 4 May 1948) is the current [[List of Tongan Monarchs|King]] of [[Tonga]].

==Early life==
Tupou V is the eldest son of the late King [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV|Tāufa{{okina}}āhau Tupou IV]], and was appointed [[Crown Prince]] on 4 May 1966. In daily life, he was better known by one of his traditional chiefly titles '''Tupouto{{okina}}a'''.

The king attended [[primary school]] in [[Switzerland]] and secondary school at [[King's College, Auckland|King's College]] in [[Auckland]] and [[The Leys School]] in Cambridge[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4419058.ece], and went on to study at [[Oxford University]] and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in England.

==Crown Prince==
As Crown Prince, Tupouto{{okina}}a held great influence in Tongan politics, and was [[Minister for Foreign Affairs]] from 1979 to 1998. He has substantial business interests in Tonga and abroad, and is co-chairman of the [[Shoreline Group]]/[[Tonfön]]. As king, his first proclamation was that he would dispose of all his business assets as soon as reasonably possible, and in accordance with the law. Tonfön has since been sold, but the King was unable to get rid of the remainder of the Shoreline Group after the [[2006 Nuku'alofa riots]] scared potential buyers from making a deal.

==Personal life==
The King is unmarried and has no children recognised as successors. He has, however, a daughter born out of marriage, [['Ilima Lei Tohi|{{okina}}Ilima Lei Tohi]] and, through her, is already a grandfather. According to the constitution of Tonga, {{okina}}Ilima is ineligible to [[Line of succession to the Tongan throne|inherit the throne]].<ref>{{cite news |date=17 September 2006 |author=Jane Phare |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=2&ObjectID=10401690 |title=The madness of King George of Tonga |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=2006-10-21}}</ref>

==King==
Tupou V was sworn in as King on 11 September 2006,<ref>[http://www.pmo.gov.to/artman/publish/article_170.shtml Tongan Government Gazette Publication 20] and [http://www.pmo.gov.to/artman/publish/article_172.shtml Gazette Publication 19] It might be argued that he became King on his swearing in (11 Sept, midday), or on the death of his father the night before. However, although the death of his father occurred on 10 September at 23:34 in New Zealand, Siaosi was in Tonga, where the time was 0:34, 11 September.</ref> which also made him, from a traditional viewpoint, the 23rd [[Tu'i Kanokupolu|Tu{{okina}}i Kanokupolu]] (the overlords of [[Tongatapu]]).

===Coronation ceremony===
The ceremonial aspects of Tupou V's accession to the throne took place in July/August 2008.  These were initially to be held in 2007, after the [[official mourning]] period for his father (6 months for close relatives) and his own birthday but, after the [[2006 Tonga riots]], he decided to focus on the reconstruction of the destroyed capital.<ref>[http://www.matangitonga.to/article/tonganews/royalty/coronation301106.shtml user account | Matangi Tonga Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During a week of celebrations, two key ceremonies took place to mark Tupou's coronation.

On 30 July 2008, a Taumafa Kava ceremony (royal kava ring) was held on Mala{{okina}}e Pangai, the open space to the east of the Royal Palace. During the ceremony the King sat on a pile of handwoven pandanus mats on an open pavilion facing the sea, while more than 200 Tongan nobles and chiefs dressed in woven skirts and sea shells circled him. He wore the traditional Tongan ta'ovala woven mat skirt and a garland of flowers.

During this ceremony, Tupou V was formally recognised as the Tu{{okina}}i Kanokupolu, and the rightful descendent of King George Tupou I who united Tonga in the 19th century. The ceremony involved the presentation of kava to the King and assembled chiefs and nobles. Presentations of hundreds of baskets of food as well as 70 cooked [[pig]]s were made.<ref name="King of Tonga crowned">{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411366/1960158|title=King of Tonga crowned|date= 1 August 2008|publisher=TV New Zealand|accessdate=2008-08-01}}</ref>

School children held 30,000 torches on this night to proclaim Tupou V's coronation to the world.<ref name="King of Tonga crowned" /> A tupakapakanava, or traditional torch spectacle, an ancient honour accorded only to the monarch and the royal family, was held later at a spot overlooking the Pacific.<ref name="Gutted pigs and narcotic drinks welcome new king of Tonga">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/jul/30/tonga?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront|title=Gutted pigs and narcotic drinks welcome new king of Tonga|first=Barbara McMahon |date=  30 July 2008|publisher=guardian.co.uk, |accessdate=2008-08-01}}</ref>

A formal, European-style, [[coronation]] ceremony took place on 1 August 2008 in the Centennial Chapel, Nuku’alofa.<ref name="Lavish coronation ceremony for new King of Tonga">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4440717.ece|title=Lavish coronation ceremony for new King of Tonga|date= 1 August 2008|publisher=TimesOnline|accessdate=2008-08-01}}</ref> In an elaborate spectacle, the Anglican [[Archbishop]] of Polynesia [[Jabez Bryce]] invested Tupou V with the Tongan regalia, including the ring, sceptre and sword, and in the culmination of the ceremony, placed the Tongan Crown on his head.<ref name="Lavish coronation ceremony for new King of Tonga" />

===Relinquishing authority===
Three days before his coronation on 1 August 2008, the King announced that he would relinquish most of his power and be guided by his [[Prime Minister of Tonga|Prime Minister]]'s recommendations on most matters.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7530209.stm "Tonga's king to cede key powers"], BBC,  29 July 2008</ref> The Prime Minister would also be in charge of day-to-day affairs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/29/1|title=Tongan king promises 'more democracy' for Pacific island|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=2008-07-29|date=2008-07-29}}</ref> Tupou will still have the powers to appoint [[judge]]s and [[commutation of sentence|commute prison sentences]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/07/29/tonga.king/|title=Tongan king to give up absolute rule|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-07-29|date=2008-07-29}}</ref> The King also sold off lucrative business interests as part of the announcement.<ref name=NZ>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=72&objectid=10524265|title=Feudal monarch agrees to give up much of his power|publisher=NZ Herald|accessdate=2008-07-29|date=2008-07-29}}</ref> In addition, the King announced that there will be parliamentary reform and elections in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fijidailypost.com/feature.php?date=20080728&index=575|title=His Majesty King George Tupou V- A Monarch for a time of change
