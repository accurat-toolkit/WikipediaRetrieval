The  letter was derived from the Semitic ''`[[Ayin]]'' (eye), which represented a consonant, probably the [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]] ({{IPA2|ʕ}}), the sound represented by the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] letter ع called ''`Ayn''.  This Semitic letter in its original form seems to have been inspired by a similar Egyptian hieroglyph for "eye".

The Greeks are thought to have come up with the innovation of vowel characters, and lacking a pharyngeal consonant, employed this letter as the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Omicron|O]] to represent the vowel {{IPA|/o/}}, a sound it maintained in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] and [[Latin]].  In Greek, a variation of the form later came to distinguish this long sound ([[Omega]], meaning "large O") from the short o (Omicron, meaning "small o").

Its graphic form has also remained fairly constant from [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] times until today.  Indeed, even alphabets constructed "from scratch", i.e. not derived from Semitic, usually have similar forms to represent this sound—for example the creators of the [[Afaka script|Afaka]] and [[Ol Chiki script]]s, each invented in different parts of the world in the last century, both attributed their vowels for 'O' to the shape of the mouth when making this sound.

== Usage ==
O is most commonly associated with the [[close-mid back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|[o]}} in many languages. This form is colloquially termed the "long o" in [[English language|English]], but it is actually most often a [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/oʊ/}} (realized dialectically anywhere from {{IPA|[o]}} to {{IPA|[əʊ]}}).

In English there is also a "short O", which also has several pronunciations.  In most dialects of English English, it is an [[open back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ɒ]}}; in North America, it is most commonly an unrounded back to central vowel {{IPA|[ɑː]}} to {{IPA|[a]}}.

O is used at some times to mean Zero(0), which is a number. It is not wrong to use it as a number in phone numbers, room numbers, etc. 

Common digraphs include OO, which represents either {{IPA|/ʊ/}} or {{IPA|/uː/}}; OI which typically represents the diphthong {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}}; and OA, OE, and OU represent a variety of pronunciations depending on context and etymology.

Other languages use O for various values, usually back vowels which are at least partly open. Derived letters such as [[Ö]] and [[Ø]] have been created for the alphabets of some languages to distinguish values that were not present in Latin and Greek, particularly rounded front vowels.

In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{IPA|[o]}} represents the [[close-mid back rounded vowel]].

In [[Unicode]], the [[capital letter|capital]] O is codepoint U+004F and the [[Lower case|lowercase]] o is U+006F.

The [[ASCII]] code for capital O is 79 and for lowercase o is 111; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01001111 and 01101111, correspondingly.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital O is 214 and for lowercase o is 150.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are "<tt>&amp;#79;</tt>" and "<tt>&amp;#111;</tt>" for upper and lower case respectively.
