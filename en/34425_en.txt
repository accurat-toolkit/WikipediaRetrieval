'''Z''' is the twenty-sixth and final [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] of the [[basic modern Latin alphabet]]. 
==Name and pronunciation==
In many [[dialect]]s of [[English language|English]], the letter's name is '''zed''', {{pron-en|ˈzɛd}}, reflecting its derivation from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] ''[[zeta (letter)|zeta]]'' (see below). In [[American English]], its name is '''zee''' {{IPA|/ˈziː/}}, deriving from a late [[17th century]] English dialectal form.<ref>One early use of "zee": {{cite book |last1=Lye |first1=Thomas |title=A new spelling book, 1677 |year=1969 |publisher=Menston, (Yorks.) Scolar P. |origyear=2nd ed., London, 1677 |id={{LCCN|70||407159}} |page=24 |quote=Zee Za-cha-ry, Zion, zeal}}</ref> Another English dialectal form is '''izzard''' {{IPA|/ˈɪzərd/}}, which dates from the mid-18th century and probably derives from [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''izèda'' (literally translating as "i zed") or the [[French language|French]] ''et zède'' "and z".<ref>"Z" ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' 2nd edition (1989); ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International</ref>  Other [[Indo-European languages]] pronounce the letter's name in a similar fashion, such as ''zet'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Czech language|Czech]], ''zède'' in [[French language|French]], ''zæt'' in [[Danish language|Danish]], ''zäta'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''zeta'' in [[Italian language|Italian]] and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and ''zê'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. 

In [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese]] (Mandarin) [[pinyin]] the name of the letter Z is pronounced [tsɛ], although the English '''zed''' and '''zee''' have become very common.

In the Philippines, it is quite common to hear people pronounce the name of the letter Z as "zay" rhyming with "say".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The name of the [[Semitic symbol]] was ''[[zayin]]'', possibly meaning "weapon", and was the seventh letter.  It represented either {{IPA|z}} as in English and French, or possibly more like {{IPA|/dz/}} (as in Italian ''zeta'', ''zero'').

The Greek form of Z was a close copy of the Phoenician symbol <font face="Times New Roman">I</font>, and the Greek inscriptional form remained in this shape throughout ancient times. The Greeks called it ''[[Zeta (letter)|Zeta]]'', a new name made in imitation of ''Eta'' (η) and ''Theta'' (θ).

In earlier Greek of [[Athens]] and Northwest Greece, the letter seems to have represented {{IPA|/dz/}}; in Attic, from the 4th century BC onwards, it seems to have been either {{IPA|/zd/}} or a {{IPA|/dz/}}, and in fact there is no consensus concerning this issue. In other dialects, as Elean and [[Crete|Cretan]], the symbol seems to have been used for sounds resembling the English voiced and unvoiced ''th'' (IPA {{IPA|/ð/}} and {{IPA|/θ/}}, respectively). In the common dialect (κοινη) that succeeded the older dialects, ζ became {{IPA|/z/}}, as it remains in modern Greek.

In [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan]], ''Z'' may have symbolized {{IPA|/ts/}}; in Latin, {{IPA|/dz/}}. In early Latin, the sound of {{IPA|/z/}} developed into {{IPA|/r/}} and the symbol became useless. It was therefore removed from the alphabet around 300 BC by the Censor, [[Appius Claudius Caecus]], and a new letter, ''[[G]]'', was put in its place soon thereafter.

In the 1st century BC, it was, like ''[[Y]]'', introduced again at the end of the Latin alphabet, in order to represent more precisely the value of the Greek ''zeta'' &mdash; previously transliterated as ''S'' at the beginning and ''ss'' in the middle of words, eg. ''sona'' = ζωνη, "belt"; ''trapessita'' = τραπεζιτης, "banker". The letter appeared only in Greek words, and ''Z'' is the only letter besides ''Y'' that the Romans took directly from the Greek, rather than Etruscan.

In [[Vulgar Latin]], Greek ''Zeta'' seems to have represented (IPA {{IPA|/dj/}}), and later (IPA {{IPA|/dz/}}); d was for {{IPA|/z/}} in words like ''baptidiare'' for ''baptizare'' "baptize", while conversely ''Z'' appears for {{IPA|/d/}} in forms like ''zaconus'', ''zabulus'', for ''diaconus'' "deacon", ''diabulus'', "devil". ''Z'' also is often written for the consonantal ''I'' (that is, ''J'', IPA {{IPA|/j/}}) as in ''zunior'' for ''junior'' "younger".

In earlier times, the [[English alphabet]]s used by children terminated not with ''Z'' but with ''[[Ampersand|&]]'' or related typographic symbols. In her 1859 novel [[Adam Bede]], [[George Eliot]] refers to ''Z'' being followed by ''&'' when she makes Jacob Storey say, "He thought it <nowiki>[Z]</nowiki> had only been put to finish off th' alphabet like; though ampusand would ha' done as well, for what he could see."<ref>George Eliot: ''Adam Bede''.

=== Blackletter Z ===
A glyph variant of Z originating in the medieval [[Gothic minuscule]]s  and the Early Modern [[Blackletter]] typefaces is the "tailed z" (German ''geschwänztes Z'', also ''Z mit Unterschlinge'') In some [[Antiqua]] typefaces, this letter is present as a standalone letter or in ligatures. Together with [[long s]], it is also the origin of the [[ß]] ligature in German orthography.

A graphical variant of tailed Z is ''[[Ʒ|Ezh]]'', as adopted into the  [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] as the sign for the [[voiced postalveolar fricative]].

[[Unicode]] assigns codepoints for "BLACK-LETTER CAPITAL Z" and "FRAKTUR SMALL Z" in the [[Letterlike Symbols]] and [[Mathematical alphanumeric symbols]] ranges, at U+2128 {{script|Latf|ℨ}}  and U+1D537 {{script|Latf|
