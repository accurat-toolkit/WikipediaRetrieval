'''Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela''' ({{IPA2|xoˈliɬaɬa manˈdeːla|[[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] pronunciation:}}; born 18 July 1918 in Transkei, South Africa)<ref name="nobel">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1993/mandela-bio.html|title=Nelson Mandela - Biography|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|year=1993|accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> is a former [[President of South Africa|President]] of [[South Africa]], the first to be elected in a [[universal suffrage|fully representative]] democratic election, who held office from 1994–99. Before his presidency, Mandela was an anti-[[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] activist, and the leader of the [[African National Congress]]'s armed wing [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]. The [[Judiciary of South Africa|South African courts]] convicted him on charges of sabotage, as well as other crimes committed while he led the movement against apartheid. In accordance with his conviction, Mandela served 27 years in prison, spending many of these years on [[Robben Island]]. He is currently a celebrated elder [[statesman]] who continues to voice his opinion on topical issues. In South Africa he is often known as '''Madiba''', an honorary title adopted by elders of Mandela's clan. The title has come to be synonymous with Nelson Mandela.

Following his release from prison on 11 February 1990, Mandela supported reconciliation and negotiation, and helped lead the transition towards multi-racial democracy in South Africa. Since the end of apartheid, many have frequently praised Mandela, including former opponents. Mandela has received [[List of Nelson Mandela awards and honours|more than one hundred awards]] over four decades, most notably the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1993. 

==Early life==
Mandela belongs to a [[cadet branch]] of the [[Thembu]] dynasty, which [[reign]]s in the [[Transkei|Transkeian Territories]] of [[South Africa]]'s [[Cape Province]].<ref name="AllAfrica">{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200807180124.html|title=South Africa: Celebrating Mandela At 90|date=17 July 2008|publisher=AllAfrica.com|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> He was born in [[Mvezo]], a small village located in the district of [[Umtata]], the Transkei capital.<ref name="AllAfrica"/> His [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] great-grandfather [[Ngubengcuka]] (who died in 1832), ruled as the ''Inkosi Enkhulu'', or [[Monarch|king]], of the Thembu people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316920,00.html|title=Book Review - ''Higher than Hope''|last=Meer|first=Fatima|date=16 March 1990 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> One of the king's sons, named ''Mandela'', became Nelson's grandfather and the source of his [[surname]].

Mandela's father, [[Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa]], served as [[Tribal chief|chief]] of the town of Mvezo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chalre.com/hiring_executives/Great_Leader_Profiles/Profile-Nelson_Mandela.htm|title=President of South Africa: Nelson Mandela|publisher=Chalre Associates|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>  However, upon alienating the colonial authorities, they deprived Mphakanyiswa of his position, and moved his family to Qunu.  Despite this, Mphakanyiswa remained a member of the ''Inkosi's'' [[Privy Council]], and served an instrumental role in Jongintaba Dalindyebo's ascension to the Thembu throne. Dalindyebo would later return the favour by informally adopting Mandela upon Mphakanyiswa's death.<ref name="GreatSouls"> {{cite book|last=Aikman|first=David |title=Great Souls: Six Who Changed a Century|publisher=Lexington Books|date=2003|pages=70, 71|isbn=0739104381}}</ref> Mandela's father had four wives,<ref name="GreatSouls"/> with whom he fathered a total of thirteen children (four boys and nine girls).<ref name="GreatSouls"/> Mandela was born to his third wife ('third' by a complex royal ranking system), Nosekeni Fanny.

Rolihlahla Mandela became the first member of his family to attend a school, where his teacher Miss Mdingane gave him the English name "Nelson".<ref>[[#mandela1996|Mandela 1996]], p. 9.
"No one in my family had ever attended school [...] On the first day of school my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an English name.

After [[matriculation|enrolling]], Mandela began to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] at the [[Fort Hare University]], where he met [[Oliver Tambo]]. Tambo and Mandela became lifelong friends and colleagues. Mandela also became close friends with his [[kinship and descent|kinsman]], [[Kaiser Matanzima|Kaiser ("K.D.") Matanzima]] who, as royal [[scion]] of the Thembu Right Hand House, was in line for the throne of Transkei<ref name="mafela"/>, a role that would later lead him to embrace [[Bantustan]] policies. His support of these policies would place him and Mandela on opposing political sides.<ref name=port/> At the end of Nelson's first year, he became involved in a [[Students' Representative Council]] boycott against university policies, and was told to leave [[Fort Hare]] and not return unless he accepted election to the SRC.<ref>[[#mandela1996|Mandela 1996]], pp. 18-19.</ref> Later, Mandela studied for a [[Bachelor of Laws]] from the [[University of London External Programme]].

Shortly after leaving Fort Hare, Jongintaba announced to Mandela and Justice (the regent's son and heir to the throne) that he had arranged marriages for both of them. The young men, displeased by the arrangement, elected to relocate to [[Johannesburg]].<ref name="mandela1996pp10,20">[[#mandela1996|Mandela 1996]], pp. 10, 20.</ref> Upon his arrival, Mandela initially found employment as a guard at a mine.<ref name="NMF"> {{cite web|url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/index.php/memory/views/biography/|title=Nelson Mandela Biography - Early Years|publisher=Nelson Mandela Foundation|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> However, the employer quickly terminated Mandela after learning that he was the Regent's runaway [[Ward (law)|ward]]. Mandela later started work as an [[articled clerk]] at a Johannesburg law firm, Witkin, Sidelsky and Edelman, through connections with his friend and mentor, realtor [[Walter Sisulu]].<ref name="NMF"/>  While working at Witkin, Sidelsky and Edelman, Mandela completed his B.A. degree at the [[University of South Africa]] via correspondence, after which he began law studies at the [[University of Witwatersrand]], where he first befriended fellow students and future anti-apartheid political activists [[Joe Slovo]], [[Harry Schwarz]] and [[Ruth First]]. Slovo would eventually become Mandela's Minister of Housing, while Schwarz would become his [[South African ambassador to the United States|Ambassador to Washington]]. During this time Mandela lived in [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]] township, north of Johannesburg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmcf.co.za/organize.html|title=Nelson Mandela Children's Fund - Organise|publisher=Nelson Mandela Children's Fund|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>

==Political activity==
After the 1948 election victory of the [[Afrikaner]]-dominated [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which supported the [[apartheid]] policy of [[racial segregation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/SA-1948-1976/1948-election.htm|title=The 1948 election and the National Party Victory|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>  Mandela began actively participating in politics. He led prominently  in the ANC's 1952 [[Defiance Campaign]] and the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]], whose adoption of the [[Freedom Charter]] provided the fundamental basis of the anti-apartheid cause.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/struggles/defiance.html|title=The Defiance Campaign|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/campaigns/cop/index.html|title=Congress of the People, 1955|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> During this time, Mandela and fellow lawyer [[Oliver Tambo]] operated the law firm of [[Mandela and Tambo]], providing free or low-cost legal counsel to many blacks who lacked attorney representation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Callinicos|first=Luli|title=Oliver Tambo: Beyond the Engeli Mountains|publisher=New Africa Books|date=2004|pages=173|isbn=0864866666}}</ref>

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] influenced Mandela's approach, and subsequently the methods of succeeding generations of South African anti-apartheid activists.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mandela, Nelson|title=The Sacred Warrior|work=[[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]]|date=2000-01-03|url=http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/the_sacred_warrior13a.html|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Making of a Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1893–1914|author= Bhana, Surendra;  Vahed, Goolam|year=2005|page=149}}</ref> Mandela even took part in the 29 January – 30 January 2007 conference in [[New Delhi]] marking the 100th anniversary of Gandhi's introduction of [[satyagraha]] in South Africa.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bhalla, Nita|title=Mandela calls for Gandhi's non-violence approach|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-01-29|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/01/29/mandela_calls_for_gandhis_non_violence_approach/|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>  

Initially committed to [[nonviolent resistance]], Mandela and 150 others were arrested on 5 December 1956 and charged with treason. The marathon [[Treason Trial]] of 1956–1961 followed, with all defendants receiving [[acquittal]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mandela/1960s/treason.html|title=Nelson Mandela's Testimony at the Treason Trial 1956-60|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>   From 1952–1959, a new class of black activists known as the Africanists disrupted ANC activities in the townships, demanding more drastic steps against the National Party regime.<ref name="ANCStatement">{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/misc/trcall.html|title=ANC - Statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission|date=August 1996|publisher=[[African National Congress]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>  The ANC leadership under [[Albert Luthuli]], [[Oliver Tambo]] and [[Walter Sisulu]] felt not only that the Africanists were moving too fast but also that they challenged their leadership.<ref name="ANCStatement"/> The ANC leadership consequently bolstered their position through alliances with small White, Coloured, and Indian political parties in an attempt to give the appearance of wider appeal than the Africanists.<ref name="ANCStatement"/>  The Africanists ridiculed the 1955 [[Freedom Charter]] Kliptown Conference for the concession of the 100,000-strong ANC to just a single vote in a Congressional alliance. Four secretaries-general of the five participating parties secretly belonged to the reconstituted [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP), strongly adhering to the Moscow line.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=Encyclopedia of African History|publisher=CRC Press|date=2005|pages=1449|isbn=1579582451}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/charter.html|title=The Freedom Charter|publisher=[[African National Congress]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> 

In 1959, the ANC lost its most militant support when most of the Africanists, with financial support from [[Ghana]] and significant political support from the [[Transvaal]]-based [[Basotho]], broke away to form the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC) under the direction of [[Robert Sobukwe]] and [[Potlako Leballo]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Leeman|first=Bernard|title=The PAC of Azania ''in'' Africa Today|editor=Alexander, Peter; Hutchison, Ruth; Schreuder, Deryck|publisher=The Australian National University Canberra|location=The Humanities Research Centre, The Australian National University Canberra|date=1996|isbn=07315 24918}}</ref>

===Anti-apartheid activities===
In 1961, Mandela became leader of the ANC's armed wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (translated ''Spear of the Nation'', and also abbreviated ''MK''), which he co-founded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mk/mk-born.html|title=Umkhonto is Born|publisher=[[African National Congress]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> He coordinated sabotage campaigns against [[military]] and [[government]] targets, making plans for a possible [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] if the sabotage failed to end apartheid.<ref name="TerrorismReader">{{cite book|last=Whittaker|first=David J. |title=The Terrorism Reader|edition=Updated|publisher=Routledge|date=2003|pages=244|isbn=0415301017}}</ref> Mandela also raised funds for MK abroad and arranged for [[paramilitary]] training of the group.<ref name="TerrorismReader"/>

Fellow ANC member Wolfie Kadesh explains the bombing campaign led by Mandela: "When we knew that we [sic] going to start on 16 December 1961, to blast the symbolic places of apartheid, like pass offices, native magistrates courts, and things like that ... post offices and ... the government offices. But we were to do it in such a way that nobody would be hurt, nobody would get killed."<ref name="pbsfrontline">{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mandela/revolution/kodesh.html | title=Tell me about the bomb at the brickworks - Frontline The Long Walk of Nelson Mandela | publisher=PBS}}</ref> Mandela said of Wolfie: "His knowledge of warfare and his first hand battle experience were extremely helpful to me."<ref name="longwalk"/>

Mandela described the move to armed struggle as a last resort; years of increasing repression and violence from the state convinced him that many years of [[non-violence|non-violent]] protest against apartheid had not and could not achieve any progress.<ref name="longwalk">{{cite book|first=Nelson|last=Mandela|title=[[Long Walk to Freedom (book)|Long Walk to Freedom]]|year=1994|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]}}</ref><ref name="rivonia">{{cite web | author= Mandela, Nelson | title="I am Prepared to Die" — Nelson Mandela's statement from the dock at the opening of the defence case in the Rivonia Trial | publisher=[[African National Congress]] |date=1964-04-20 | url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mandela/1960s/rivonia.html | accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>

Later, mostly in the 1980s, MK waged a guerrilla war against the apartheid regime in which many [[civilian]]s became casualties.<ref name="TerrorismReader"/> Mandela later admitted that the ANC, in its struggle against apartheid, also violated human rights, sharply criticising those in his own party who attempted to remove statements supporting this fact from the reports of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Mandela admits ANC violated rights, too|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=1998-11-02}}</ref>

Up until July 2008, Mandela and ANC party members were barred from entering the United States — except the United Nations headquarters in [[Manhattan]] — without a special waiver from the [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]], because of their South African apartheid regime era designation as [[Terrorism|terrorists]].<ref name=bbcvisa>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7340248.stm|title=BBC News: US shamed by Mandela terror link|date=2008-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7484517.stm|title=Mandela taken off US terror list|work=BBC News|date =2008-07-01|accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref>

On 25 October 1962, Mandela was sentenced to five years in [[prison]]. Two years later on 11 June 1964, a verdict had been reached concerning his previous engagement in the [[African National Congress]] (ANC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/feb/11/nelsonmandela.southafrica2|title=The Rivonia Trial|last=Katwala |first=Sunder|date=11 February 2001|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>

While Mandela was imprisoned, police arrested prominent ANC leaders on 11 July 1963, at [[Liliesleaf Farm]], [[Rivonia]], north of Johannesburg. Mandela was brought in, and at the [[Rivonia Trial]] they were charged by the chief prosecutor Dr. [[Percy Yutar]] with the capital crimes of sabotage (which Mandela admitted) and crimes which were equivalent to [[treason]], but easier for the government to prove.<ref name="SAHistoryOnline"> {{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/thisday/1963-07-11ii.htm|title=ANC Lilliesleaf Farm arrests|date=11 July 1963|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>  The second charge accused the defendants of plotting a foreign invasion of South Africa, which Mandela denied.<ref name="SAHistoryOnline"/>

In his statement from the dock at the opening of the defence case in the trial on 20 April 1964 at [[Pretoria]] Supreme Court, Mandela laid out the reasoning in the ANC's choice to use violence as a tactic.<ref name="GuardianMadiba"> {{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/apr/23/nelsonmandela|title=An ideal for which I am prepared to die|last=Mandela|first=Nelson|date=20 April 1964|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>  His statement described how the ANC had used peaceful means to resist apartheid for years until the [[Sharpeville Massacre]].<ref name="TimeMag">{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869441-1,00.html|title=The Sharpeville Massacre|date=4 April 1960|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>  That event coupled with the referendum establishing the Republic of South Africa and the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] along with the banning of the ANC made it clear to Mandela and his compatriots that their only choice was to resist through acts of sabotage and that doing otherwise would have been tantamount to unconditional surrender.<ref name="TimeMag"/> Mandela went on to explain how they developed the Manifesto of [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] on 16 December 1961 intent on exposing the failure of the National Party's policies after the economy would be threatened by foreigners' unwillingness to risk investing in the country.<ref name=mk>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/manifesto-mk.html|title=Manifesto of Umkhonto we Sizwe|publisher=[[African National Congress]]|date=1961-12-16|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> He closed his statement with these words:

In March 1982 Mandela was transferred from Robben Island to [[Pollsmoor Prison]], along with other senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, [[Ahmed Kathrada]] and [[Raymond Mhlaba]].<ref name="Memoirs"/> It was speculated that this was to remove the influence of these senior leaders on the new generation of young black activists imprisoned on Robben Island, the so-called "Mandela University".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/mandela/index.html|title=Nelson Mandela and the Rainbow of Culture|last=Hallengren|first=Anders|date=11 September 2001|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> However, [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] minister [[Kobie Coetsee]] says that the move was to enable discreet contact between them and the South African government.<ref name=sparks/>

In 1988 Mandela was moved to [[Victor Verster Prison]] and would remain there until his release. Various restrictions were lifted and people such as [[Harry Schwarz]] were able to visit him. Schwarz, a friend of Mandela, had known him since university when they were in the same law class. He was also a defense barrister at the Rivonia Trial and would become Mandela's ambassador to [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] during his presidency.

Throughout Mandela's imprisonment, local and international pressure mounted on the South African government to release him, under the resounding slogan ''Free Nelson Mandela!''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/campaigns/prisoner.html|title=Free Nelson Mandela|date=July 1988|publisher=[[African National Congress|ANC]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> In 1989, South Africa reached a crossroads when Botha suffered a stroke and was replaced as president by [[Frederik Willem de Klerk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/pw-botha-unrepentant-defender-of-apartheid-dies-aged-90-422425.html|title=PW Botha, unrepentant defender of apartheid, dies aged 90|date=1 November 2006 |publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> De Klerk announced Mandela's release in February 1990.<ref>{{cite book|last=Malam|first=John|title=The Release of Nelson Mandela: 11 February 1990|publisher=Cherrytree Books|date=2002|isbn=1842341030}}</ref>

On 2 February 1990, [[State President of South Africa|State President]] F.W. de Klerk reversed the ban on the ANC and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/11/newsid_2539000/2539947.stm|title=1990: Freedom for Nelson Mandela|date=11 February 1990|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> Mandela was released from [[Victor Verster Prison]] in [[Paarl]] on 11 February 1990.

On the day of his release, Mandela made a speech to the nation.<ref name="ANCSpeech"> {{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mandela/1990/release.html|title=Nelson Mandela's address to Rally in Cape Town on his Release from Prison|date=11 February 1990|publisher=[[African National Congress|ANC]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> He declared his commitment to peace and reconciliation with the country's white minority, but made it clear that the ANC's armed struggle was not yet over:

{{cquote|Our resort to the armed struggle in 1960 with the formation of the military wing of the ANC ([[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]) was a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid. The factors which necessitated the armed struggle still exist today. We have no option but to continue. We express the hope that a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement would be created soon, so that there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle.}} 

He also said his main focus was to bring peace to the black majority and give them the [[Suffrage|right to vote]] in both national and local elections.<ref name="ANCSpeech"/>

===Negotiations===
{{Main|Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa}}  
Following his release from prison, Mandela returned to the leadership of the ANC and, between 1990 and 1994, led the party in the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|multi-party negotiations]] that led to the country's first multi-racial elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/crime-humanity/menu.htm|title=A Crime Against Humanity - Analysing the Repression of the Apartheid State|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref>   

In 1991, the ANC held its first national conference in South Africa after its unbanning, electing Mandela as President of the organisation. His old friend and colleague Oliver Tambo, who had led the organisation in exile during Mandela's imprisonment, became National Chairperson.<ref name=ancprofile>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/people/mandela.html|publisher=[[African National Congress]]|title=Profile of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela|accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref>

Mandela's leadership through the negotiations, as well as his relationship with President F.W. de Klerk, was recognised when they were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1993. However, the relationship was sometimes strained, particularly so in a sharp exchange in 1991 when he furiously referred to De Klerk as the head of "an illegitimate, discredited, minority regime". The talks broke down following the [[Boipatong massacre]] in June 1992 when Mandela took the ANC out of the negotiations, accusing De Klerk's government of complicity in the killings.<ref name=boipatong>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pr/1992/pr0618.html|title=Boipatong Massacre|date=1992-06-18|accessdate=2008-05-26|publisher=[[African National Congress]]}}</ref> However, talks resumed following the [[Bisho massacre]] in September 1992, when the spectre of violent confrontation made it clear that negotiations were the only way forward.<ref name=longwalk/>

Following the assassination of ANC leader [[Chris Hani]] in April 1993, there were renewed fears that the country would erupt in violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14028944.html|title=Chris Hani assassinated. (Obituary)|publisher=Social Justice |accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref> Mandela addressed the nation appealing for calm, in a speech regarded as 'presidential' even though he was not yet president of the country at that time: {{cquote|Tonight I am reaching out to every single South African, black and white, from the very depths of my being. A white man, full of prejudice and hate, came to our country and committed a deed so foul that our whole nation now teeters on the brink of disaster. A white woman, of Afrikaner origin, risked her life so that we may know, and bring to justice, this assassin. The cold-blooded murder of Chris Hani has sent shock waves throughout the country and the world. ...Now is the time for all South Africans to stand together against those who, from any quarter, wish to destroy what Chris Hani gave his life for – the freedom of all of us.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?doc=ancdocs/history/mandela/1993/pr930410.html|title=Statement of the President of the ANC, Nelson Mandela on the assassination of Martin Chris Hani|date=10 April 1993|accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref> }} While some riots did follow the assassination, the negotiators were galvanised into action, and soon agreed that democratic elections should take place on 27 April 1994, just over a year after Hani's assassination.<ref name=sparks/>

==Presidency of South Africa==
South Africa's [[South African general election, 1994|first multi-racial elections]] in which full enfranchisement was granted were held on 27 April 1994. The ANC won 62% of the votes in the election, and Mandela, as leader of the ANC, was inaugurated on 10 May 1994 as the country's first black [[President of South Africa|President]], with the National Party's de Klerk as his first [[Deputy President of South Africa|deputy]] and [[Thabo Mbeki]] as the second in the [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|Government of National Unity]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Mandela becomes SA's first black president | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/10/newsid_2661000/2661503.stm  | accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> As President from May 1994 until June 1999, Mandela presided over the transition from minority rule and apartheid, winning international respect for his advocacy of national and international reconciliation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1993/presentation-speech.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1993 - Presentation Speech|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> Mandela encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated [[South African national rugby union team|''Springboks'']] (the South African national rugby team) as South Africa hosted the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/team_pages/south_africa/3167692.stm|title=Mandela rallies Springboks|date=6 October 2003|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref>  After the Springboks won an epic final over New Zealand, Mandela presented the trophy to captain [[Francois Pienaar]], an Afrikaner, wearing a Springbok shirt with Pienaar's own number 6 on the back.

===Lockerbie trial===
President Mandela took a particular interest in helping to resolve the long-running dispute between [[Muammar al-Gaddafi|Gaddafi]]'s Libya, on the one hand, and the United States and Britain on the other, over bringing to trial the two Libyans who were indicted in November 1991 and accused of sabotaging [[Pan Am Flight 103]], which crashed at the Scottish town of [[Lockerbie]] on 21 December 1988, with the loss of 270 lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/jan/31/lockerbie.derekbrown|title=Lockerbie trial: what happened when|last=Brown|first=Derek|date=31 January 2001|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> As early as 1992, Mandela informally approached President [[George H.W.

==Retirement==
Mandela became the oldest elected President of South Africa when he took office at the age of 75 in 1994. He decided not to stand for a second term as President, and instead retired in 1999, to be succeeded by [[Thabo Mbeki]].

After his retirement as President, Mandela went on to become an advocate for a variety of social and human rights organisations. He has expressed his support for the international [[Make Poverty History]] movement of which the [[ONE Campaign]] is a part.<ref name=povertyhistory>{{cite web | url=http://www.makepovertyhistory.org/theyearof | title=2005: The year of Make Poverty History | publisher=Make Poverty History | accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref> The [[Nelson Mandela Invitational]] charity golf tournament, hosted by [[Gary Player]], has raised over twenty million [[South African rand|rands]] for children's charities since its inception in 2000.<ref name="MandelaInv">{{cite web|url=http://www.nelsonmandelainvitational.co.za/default.asp?id=227875&des=article|title=SA's best to join international stars for charity|date=5 September 2007|publisher=Nelson Mandela Invitational|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref>

===Health===
In July 2001 Mandela was diagnosed and treated for [[prostate cancer]]. He was treated with a seven-week course of radiation.<ref>{{cite news | publisher=BBC | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1492865.stm | title=Mandela 'responding well to treatment' | date=2001-08-15|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> In June 2004, at age 85, Mandela announced that he would be retiring from public life. His health had been declining, and he wanted to enjoy more time with his family. Mandela said that he did not intend to hide away totally from the public, but wanted to be in a position "of calling you to ask whether I would be welcome, rather than being called upon to do things and participate in events. My appeal therefore is: Don't call me, I will call you."<ref>{{cite web | title="I'll call you" | publisher=SouthAfrica.info | date=2004-06-02 | url=http://www.southafrica.info/mandela/mandela-retirement.htm | accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> Since 2003, he has appeared in public less often and has been less vocal on topical issues.<ref name=retirement/>  He is white-haired and walks slowly with the support of a stick.

===Elders===
On 18 July 2007, Nelson Mandela, [[Graça Machel]], and [[Desmond Tutu]] convened a group of world leaders in Johannesburg to contribute their wisdom and independent leadership to address the world's toughest problems. Nelson Mandela announced the formation of this new group, [[Global Elders|The Elders]], in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19836050 | title=Mandela joins ‘Elders’ on turning 89 | publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=2008-05-26 | date=2007-07-20}}</ref>

Archbishop Tutu serves as the chair of The Elders. The founding members of this group also include Graça Machel, [[Kofi Annan]], [[Ela Bhatt]], [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Li Zhaoxing]], [[Mary Robinson]] and [[Muhammad Yunus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/mandela/theelders.htm|title=Mandela launches The Elders|date=19 July 2007 |publisher=SAinfo|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref>

"This group can speak freely and boldly, working both publicly and behind the scenes on whatever actions need to be taken", Mandela commented.  "Together we will work to support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is conflict, and inspire hope where there is despair."<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-26|url=http://www.theelders.org/transcript.aspx|title=Nelson Mandela announces The Elders|publisher=The Elders}}</ref>

===AIDS engagement===
Since his retirement, one of Mandela's primary commitments has been to the fight against [[AIDS]]. He gave the closing address at the [[XIII International AIDS Conference, 2000|XIII International AIDS Conference]] in 2000, in Durban, South Africa.<ref>Paul Tebas, MD, "Closing Ceremony," http://www.thebody.com/content/art16140.html</ref> In 2003, he had already lent his support to the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] AIDS fundraising campaign, named after his prison number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.46664.com/2|title=About 46664|publisher=46664.com|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> In July 2004, he flew to [[Bangkok]] to speak at the [[XV International AIDS Conference, 2004|XV International AIDS Conference]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaisernetwork.org/aids2004/kffsyndication.asp?show=portal_071504.html|title=XV International AIDS Conference - Daily Coverage|date=15 July 2004|publisher=Kaisernetwork|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref>  His son, [[Makgatho Mandela]], died of AIDS on 6 January 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4151159.stm|title=Mandela's eldest son dies of Aids|date=6 January 2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref>  Mandela's AIDS activism is chronicled in [[Stephanie Nolen]]'s book, [[28 (book)|28: Stories of AIDS in Africa]].

===Iraq invasion views===
In 2002 and 2003, Mandela criticised the foreign policy of the [[George W. Bush administration|administration]] of [[U.S. president]] [[George W. Bush]] in a number of speeches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2228971.stm|title=Mandela warns Bush over Iraq|date=1 September 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/mandela-lambastes-arrogant-bush-over-iraq-609026.html|title=Mandela lambastes 'arrogant' Bush over Iraq|last=Cornwell|first=Rupert |date=31 January 2003|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Criticising the lack of [[UN]] involvement in the decision to begin the [[War in Iraq]], he said, "It is a tragedy, what is happening, what Bush is doing. But Bush is now undermining the [[United Nations]]." Mandela stated he would support action against [[Iraq]] only if it is ordered by the [[UN]]. Mandela also insinuated that Bush may have been motivated by [[racism]] in not following the [[UN]] and its secretary-general [[Kofi Annan]] on the issue of the war. "Is it because the secretary-general of the United Nations is now a black man? They never did that when secretary-generals were white".<ref name="CBS30012003">{{cite web | author= Fenton, Tom | publisher=[[CBS]] | title=Mandela Slams Bush On Iraq | date=2003-01-30 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/30/iraq/main538607.shtml | accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>

He urged the people of the U.S. to join massive protests against Bush and called on world leaders, especially those with vetoes in the [[UN Security Council]], to oppose him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/30/iraq/main538607.shtml|title=Mandela Slams Bush On Iraq|date=30 January 2003|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref> "What I am condemning is that one power, with a president who has no foresight, who cannot think properly, is now wanting to plunge the world into a holocaust."

"If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, it is the United States of America. They don't care."<ref name="CBS30012003"/>

===Ismail Ayob controversy===
{{See|Ismail Ayob}}
[[Ismail Ayob]] was a trusted friend and personal attorney of Mandela for over 30&nbsp;years. In May 2005, Ayob was asked by Mandela to stop selling [[printmaking|prints]] signed by Mandela and to account for the proceeds of their sale. This bitter dispute led to an extensive application to the [[High Court of South Africa]] by Mandela that year.<ref>{{cite news | work=Mail & Guardian | title=Mandela sues over forged sketches | author= Chanda, Abhik Kumar | date=2005-05-10 | url=http://www.mg.co.za/articledirect.aspx?articleid=237663|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> Ayob denied any wrongdoing,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/specialreports.aspx?ID=BD4A67853 | publisher=Business Day | date=2005-07-13 | title=Ayob denies gain from Mandela art | first=Ernest | last=Mabuza|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> and claimed that he was the victim of a smear campaign orchestrated by Mandela's advisors, in particular, lawyer [[George Bizos]].<ref name=poorismail>{{cite news|title=Poor Ismail Ayob|first=Fikile-Notsikelelo|last=Moya|date=2005-08-05|publisher=Mail & Guardian|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=247331&area=/insight/insight__comment_and_analysis/|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> 

In 2005, and 2006 Ayob, his wife, and son were subject to an attack by Mandela's advisors. The dispute was widely reported in the media, with Ayob being portrayed in a negative light, culminating in the action by Mandela to the High Court. There were public meetings at which Mandela associates attacked Ayob and there were calls for Ayob and his family to be ostracised by society.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/specialreports.aspx?ID=BD4A71659|date=2005-07-21|title=

The dispute again made headlines in February 2007 when, during a hearing in the Johannesburg High Court, Ayob promised to pay R700 000 to Mandela, which Ayob had transferred into trusts for Mandela's children, and apologised,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,9294,2-7-1442_2075833,00.html|title=Ayob to pay back Mandela money|date=2007-02-27|publisher=[[News24]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref><ref name=whatcaused>{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20070304081421601C920210|title=What caused the Ayob, Mandela spat? |first=Jeremy|last=Gordin |date=2007-03-04|work=[[Sunday Independent]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> although he later claimed that he was the victim of a "[[Feud|vendetta]]", by Mandela.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20070303084618645C367333|title=Mandela waging a vendetta - Ayob |date=2007-03-03|first=Michael|last=Schmidt|publisher=Pretoria News}}</ref>  Some media commentators expressed sympathy for Ayob's position, pointing out that Mandela's iconic status would make it difficult for Ayob to be treated fairly.<ref name=poorismail/>

====Allegations====
Ayob, George Bizos and Wim Trengove were trustees of the Nelson Mandela Trust, which was set up to hold millions of rands donated to Nelson Mandela by prominent business figures, including the [[Nicky Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] family, for the benefit of his children and grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-02-25-mandelas-lawyers-take-ismail-to-court-over-money|title=Mandela's lawyers take Ismail to court over money|date=25 February 2007 |publisher=Mail & Guardian|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Ayob later resigned from the Trust. In 2006, the two remaining trustees of the Nelson Mandela Trust launched an application against Ayob for disbursing money from the trust without their consent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/City_Press/News/0,7515,186-187_2078129,00.html|date=2007-03-03|title=Madiba set me up, says Ayob|author= Sefara, Makhudu;  Mapiloko, Jackie|publisher=[[News24]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> Ayob claimed that this money was paid to the [[South African Revenue Service]], to Mandela's children and grandchildren, to Mandela himself, and to an accounting company for four years of accounting work.<ref name=whatcaused/>

Bizos and Trengrove refused to ratify the payments to the children and grandchildren of Nelson Mandela and the payments to the accounting firm. A court settlement was reached in which this money, totalling over R700,000 was paid by Ismail Ayob to the trust on the grounds that Ayob had not sought the express consent of the other two trustees before disbursing the money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20060708085708263C605474|title='Ayob tried to cover up unlawful spending' |last=Adams |first=Sheena |date=8 July 2006|publisher=IOL|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref>  It was alleged that Ayob made defamatory remarks about Mandela in his affidavit, for which the court order stated that Ayob should apologise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-159966227.html|title=Lawyer to pay back R800000 to Mandela trust|last=Mkhwanazi |first=Siyabonga|date=28 February 2007|publisher=Pretoria News (South Africa)|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> It was pointed out that these remarks, which centred on Nelson Mandela holding foreign bank accounts and not paying tax on these, had not originated from Ayob's affidavit but from Nelson Mandela's and George Bizos's own affidavits.<ref name=ismailnocash>{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200703100051.html|title=Ayob Runs Out of Cash But Accuses Mandela Again|publisher=Business Day|date=2007-03-10|first=Ernest|last=Mabuza|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>

===Blood Diamond controversy===
In a ''[[The New Republic]]'' article in December 2006, Nelson Mandela was criticised for a number of positive comments he had made about the diamond industry. There were concerns that this would benefit suppliers of [[blood diamond]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jckonline.com/article/CA6346260.html|title=Nelson Mandela to speak out for diamond industry|last=Bates|first=Rob|date=22 June 2006|publisher=Jewelers' Circular Keystone|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> In a letter to [[Edward Zwick]], the director of the motion picture ''[[Blood Diamond (film)|Blood Diamond]]'', Mandela had noted that:

{{quote|...it would be deeply regrettable if the making of the film inadvertently obscured the truth, and, as a result, led the world to believe that an appropriate response might be to cease buying mined diamonds from Africa. ... We hope that the desire to tell a gripping and important real life historical story will not result in the destabilization of African diamond producing countries, and ultimately their peoples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20061218&s=chotiner121806|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070308142504/http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20061218&s=chotiner121806|archivedate=2007-03-08 |title=Half Nelson - Mandela, diamond shill|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=2006-12-08|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>}}

The ''New Republic'' article claims that this comment, as well as various pro-diamond-industry initiatives and statements during his life and during his time as a president of South Africa, were influenced by both his friendship with [[Harry Oppenheimer]], former chairman of [[De Beers]], as well as an outlook for 'narrow national interests' of South Africa (which is a major diamond producer).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedishrag/2006/06/mandela-to-defe.html|title=Mandela to defend De Beers from bad "Blood"|last= Snead|first=Elizabeth|date=15 June 2006|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref>

=== Zimbabwe and Robert Mugabe ===
[[Robert Mugabe]], the president of [[Zimbabwe]] who has led the country since independence in 1980, has been widely criticised internationally for the 1980s [[Gukurahundi|fighting which killed about 3000 people]] as well as corruption, incompetent administration, political oppression and cronyism that has ultimately led to the economic collapse of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?p=97|title=Gukurahundi and current wave of violence similar|last=Chimuka|first=Garikai|date=14 May 2008|publisher=The Zimbabwe Times|accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1709488.stm|title=Mugabe's descent into dictatorship|last= Winter|first=Joseph|date=13 March 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref>

On 27 August 2008, a statue of Nelson Mandela was unveiled at Groot Drakenstein Correction Centre ( ref Drakenstein Correction centre) between Paarl and Franshhoek on the R301 road, near Cape Town. Formerly known as Victor Verster, this was where Mandela spent the last few years of his 27 years in jail in relative comfort, as he and other ANC stalwarts negotiated with the apartheid government on the terms of his release and the nature of the new South Africa.
It stands on the very spot where Mandela took his first steps as a free man. Just outside the prison gates – the culmination of the Long Walk to Freedom – the title of Mandela's autobiography.
