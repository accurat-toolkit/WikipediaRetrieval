The '''Coral Sea''' is a [[marginal sea]] off the north-east coast of [[Australia]]. It is bounded in the west by the east coast of [[Queensland]], thereby including the [[Great Barrier Reef]], in the east by [[Vanuatu]] (formerly the [[New Hebrides]]) and by [[New Caledonia]], and in the north approximately by the southern extremity of the [[Solomon Islands]].<ref name="Pacific Islands Pilot"> [http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/websites/pollux/pollux.nss.nima.mil/NAV_PUBS/SD/pub127/127sec06.pdf]></ref> South of it is the [[Tasman Sea]].

While the [[Great Barrier Reef]] with its islands and cays belong to Queensland, most reefs and islets east of it are part of the [[Coral Sea Islands Territory]]. In addition, some islands west of and belonging to [[New Caledonia]] are also part of the Coral Sea Islands in a geographical sense, such as the [[Chesterfield Islands]] and [[Bellona Reefs]].

The Coral Sea [[basin (geology)|Basin]] was formed between 58 million - 48 million years ago because the Queensland continental shelf was uplifted, forming the [[Great Dividing Range]], and continental blocks subsided at the same time.<ref name="Geomorphology pp.19">{{cite book
