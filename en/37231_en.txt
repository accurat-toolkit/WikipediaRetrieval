'''13''' ({{audio|En-us-thirteen.ogg|'''thirteen'''}}) is the [[natural number]] after [[12 (number)|12]] and before [[14 (number)|14]]. It is the smallest integer with eight letters in its spelled out name in English. It is also the age at which children officially become teenagers.

In speech, the numbers 13 and 30 are often confused. When carefully enunciated, they differ in which syllable is [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]]: 13 {{IPA-en|θərˈtiːn|}} vs 30 {{IPA-en|ˈθɜrti|}}. However, in dates such as [[1300]] ("thirteen hundred") or when contrasting numbers in the teens, such as ''13, 14, 15,'' the stress shifts to the first syllable: 13 {{IPA-en|ˈθɜrtiːn|}}.

Strikingly similar folkloric aspects of the number 13 have been noted in various cultures around the world: one theory is that this is due to the cultures employing lunar-solar calendars (there are approximately 12.41 lunations per solar year, and hence 12 "true months" plus a smaller, and often portentous, thirteenth month). This can be witnessed, for example, in the "[[Twelve Days of Christmas]]" of Western European tradition. <ref>Thompson, Tok. 2002.  The thirteenth number : Then, there/ here and now. 'Studia Mythological Slavica'' vol 5. 145-159. </ref>

===Sikhism===
According to famous [[Sakhi]] (Evidence) or story of [[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]], when he was an accountant at a town of [[Sultanpur Lodhi]], he was distributing grocery to people and when he gave groceries to the 13th person he stopped there because in [[Gurmukhi]] and Hindi the word 13 is called Terah, which means yours. And Guru Nanak kept on saying, "Yours, yours, yours..." remembering God. People reported to the emperor that Guru Nanak was giving out free food to the people. When treasures were checked, there was more money than before.

The word "Waheguru" appears only 13 times in [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the [[Sikh holy scriptures]] and the eternal Guru.

===Unlucky 13===
{{main|Triskaidekaphobia}}

The number 13 is associated with bad luck in some countries, and even has a specifically recognized [[phobia]], Triskaidekaphobia, a word which was coined in 1911. [[Friday the 13th]] has been considered an unlucky day since the 1800s, as a combination between an unlucky day, Friday, and the number 13.

===Lucky 13===
In [[Sikhism]], the number 13 is considered a special number since 13 is ''tera'' in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], which also means "yours" (as in, "I am yours, O Lord"). The legend goes that when [[Guru Nanak Dev]] was taking stock of items as part of his employment with a village merchant, he counted from 1 to 13 (in Punjabi) as one does normally; and thereafter he would just repeat "tera", since all items were God's creation. The merchant confronted [[Guru Nanak]] about this, but found everything to be in order after the inventory was checked. April 13 also usually turns out to be [[Vaisakhi]] every year, which is the Sikh New Year and the major Sikh Holiday.

Several successful sports figures have worn the number 13. [[Ozzie Guillén]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]] of the [[2005 World Series|2005 World Series Champion]] [[Chicago White Sox]], has worn the number throughout his [[baseball]] career. [[Alex Rodriguez]] began wearing it upon joining the [[New York Yankees]] (three, the number he had previously worn, is retired by the Bronx Bombers to honor [[Babe Ruth]]). [[Dan Marino]], an [[American football]] player known for passing the 2nd most yards in [[NFL]] history, wore the number 13. Basketball great [[Wilt Chamberlain]] wore the number 13 on his jersey throughout his [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] career. Also, [[FIBA]] rules require a player to wear the number in international competitions (only numbers from 4 to 15 could be worn, and as there are 12 players, one must wear 13);  [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]], who wore #20 in college and #17 in the NBA, wore #13 for both (1984 and 1992) of his Olympic appearances. [[Shaquille O'Neal]] wore #13 in 1996, [[Tim Duncan]] wore #13 in 2004, [[Steve Nash]] is currently wearing it for the [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Yao Ming]] wore it in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, and [[Mats Sundin]] and [[Bill Guerin]] wear 13 in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]. One of Iceland's all time best handball players, Sigurður Sveinsson, wore the number 13 when he played for the national team. In [[association football]], both [[Gerd Müller]] and [[Michael Ballack]] have favoured the number 13, among others. 

In [[Italy]], 13 is also considered to be a lucky number, although in [[Campania]] the expression 'tredici' (meaning 13) is said when one considers their luck to have turned for the worse.

[[Colgate University]] also considers 13 to be a lucky number. They were founded in 1819 by 13 men with 13 dollars, 13 prayers, and 13 articles. (To this day, members of the Colgate community consider the number 13 a good omen.) In fact, the campus address is 13 Oak Drive in Hamilton, NY and the all men a cappella group is called the Colgate 13.
