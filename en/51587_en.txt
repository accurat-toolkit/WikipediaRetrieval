'''Sevastopol''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Севастополь, [[Russian language|Russian]]: Севастополь, {{lang-crh|Aqyar}}) ([[#Orthography and pronunciation of the name|see pronunciation below]]) is a [[port|port city]] in [[Ukraine]], located on the [[Black Sea]] coast of the [[Crimea]] [[peninsula]]. It has a population of 342,451 (2001).<ref name="geohive">[http://www.xist.org/cntry/ukraine.aspx GeoHive: Country Data: Ukraine]</ref> The city, formerly the home of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Black Sea Fleet]], is now home to a Ukrainian [[naval base]] and facilities leased by the [[Russian Navy]] and used as the headquarters of both the Ukrainian Naval Forces and Russia's [[Black Sea Fleet]]. 

The unique geographic location and navigation conditions of the city's [[harbor|harbours]] make Sevastopol a strategically important naval point. It is also a popular [[seaside resort]] and [[tourism|tourist]] destination, mainly for visitors from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) countries.

The trade and [[shipbuilding]] importance of Sevastopol's Port has been growing since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]],{{Fact|date=July 2008}} despite the difficulties that arise from the joint military control over its harbours and [[pier]]s.

Sevastopol is also an important centre of [[marine biology]] research. In particular, studying and training of [[dolphin]]s has been conducted in the city since the end of [[World War II]].  It was first conducted as a secret naval program to use the animals for special undersea operations.

==Political status and subdivision==
[[Image:Sevastopl View.jpg|left|thumb|View of Sevastopol]]
Administratively, Sevastopol is a [[municipality]] excluded from the surrounding [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] (see [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine]] for more details). The territory of the municipality is 863.5&nbsp;km² and it is further subdivided into four [[raion]]s ([[districts]]). Besides the City of Sevastopol proper, it also includes 2 towns — [[Balaklava]], [[Inkerman]], [[urban-type settlement]] Kacha, and 29 villages.

==History==

Sevastopol together with [[Kronstadt]] and [[Gibraltar]] is one of the most famous naval [[citadel]]s in Europe. It was founded in [[1783]] by Rear Admiral Makenzie, in Russian service, as a base for a naval squadron, when [[Russian Empire|Russia]] [[annexation|annexed]] the Crimean peninsula.  Five years earlier Aleksandr Suvorov ordered that earth works be erected along the harbor and Russian troops be located there.  At first the place was called by its ancient name, Akhtiar.  In February 1784 Catherine II (the Great) ordered [[Grigory Potyomkin]] (Grigoriy Potemkin) to build there a fortress and call it Sevastopol.  The realization of the initial building plans fell to Captain F.F. Ushakov, in 1788 named commander of the port and of the Black Sea squadron.<ref>http://www.sevastopol.info/history/hist_first.htm</ref><ref>Wikipedia Russian language version</ref>  It became an important naval base and later a commercial [[Seaport|port]]. In 1797 under an edict issued by Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], the military stronghold was renamed Akhtiar. Finally, on April 29 (May 10), [[1826]], the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.

[[Image:Musee Sevastopol.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Panorama Museum of Sevastopol]]
One of the most notable events involving the city is the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)]] carried out by the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Sardinia]]n, and [[Turkey|Turkish]] troops during the [[Crimean War]], which lasted for 11 months. Despite its efforts, the Russian army had to leave its stronghold and evacuate over a pontoon bridge to the north shore of the inlet. The Russians had to sink their entire fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy and at the same time to block the entrance of the Western ships into the inlet. When the enemy troops entered Sevastopol, they were faced with the ruins of a formerly glorious city.

A [[panorama]] of the siege created by [[Franz Roubaud]] and restored after its destruction in 1942 is housed in a specially constructed circular building in the city. It portrays the situation in the height of the siege, on [[18 June]] [[1855]]. 

[[Image:Totleben.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Eduard Totleben]] Monument in Sevastopol (1909).]]
During [[World War II]] Sevastopol withstood bombardment by the Germans in 1941&ndash;1942, during the [[Battle of Sevastopol|Axis siege]] which lasted for 250 days before it fell in July 1942. The city was renamed as "Theodorichhafen" in 1942. It was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on [[May 9]], [[1944]] and was awarded with the [[Hero City]]  title a year later.

In [[1957]], the town of [[Balaklava]] was incorporated into Sevastopol. 

During the [[Soviet]] era, Sevastopol, became a so-called "[[closed city]]". This meant that any non-residents had to apply to the authorities for a temporary permit to visit the city. It was directly subordinate to the central [[Russian SFSR]] authorities rather than the local [[oblast]] and later (after 1978) to the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian]] SSR administration.<ref>[http://www.warsawvoice.pl/archiwum.phtml/275/] The Warsaw Voice, "Fleeting Disagreements", 1996</ref> 

On July 10, 1993 the [[Russian parliament]] passed a resolution declaring Sevastopol to be "a federal Russian city". At the time many supporters of then [[President of Russia|President]] [[Yeltsin]] had ceased taking part in the Parliaments work.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/world/russian-parliament-votes-a-claim-to-ukrainian-port-of-sevastopol.html?scp=5&sq=Sevastopol&st=cse Russian Parliament Votes a Claim to Ukrainian Port of Sevastopol], [[The New York Times]] (July 10, 1993)</ref> In May 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed the "Peace & Friendship" treaty ruling out Moscow's territorial claims to Ukraine. <ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200512/28/eng20051228_231329.html] People's Times, December 28, 2005</ref>

Like in the rest of the [[Crimea]], Russian remains the predominant language in the city, although following the independence of [[Ukraine]] there have been some attempts at [[Ukrainization]] that have had very little success. [[Government of Ukraine|government]]-appointed administration retains formal control of Sevastopol's life (such as of [[taxation]] and [[police|civil policing]]) and tries to avoid confrontation with the Black Sea base command and pro-Russian groups. A few years ago, the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communist]]-dominated city council rejected a [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]] loan to renovate Sevastopol's poor [[sewage]] system, declaring that the project was intended to increase the city's dependence on the Ukrainian government and the [[Western world|West]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

The WE Youth Political Organization, which advocates Russian citizenship for Sevastopol residents,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wana.crimea.ua/site/en/news/latest/6.html |title=The Open Letter to Pres. Putin on Citizenship for Sevastopol |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2008-08-10 |publisher=WE Youth Political Organization }}</ref> published a poll in 2004 claiming "72% of the Sevastopol citizens support the idea of the independent status of Crimea... Besides, 95% of the respondents support the constant stationing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol even after 2017, when the time of the corresponding agreement between Russia and Ukraine is up. Also, 100% of the interrogated people are for the accordance of the having a double citizenship, Russian and Ukrainian, right to the Sevastopol citizens. Although it is notable those in case of obtaining the Russian citizenship only 16% of the Sevastopol citizens are ready to give up the Ukrainian one."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wana.crimea.ua/site/en/news/interviews/72.html |title=72% of the Sevastopol citizens support the idea of the independent Crimea |date=October 2004 |accessdate=2008-08-10 |publisher=WE Youth Political Organization }}</ref>

==Etymology of the name==<!-- This section is linked from [[List of subnational name etymologies]] -->
[[Image:Hersones Crimea Sevastopol.jpg|thumb|225px|The ruins of an ancient Greek theatre. [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], Sevastopol.]]
The name of Sevastopolis (Modern {{lang-el|''Σεβαστούπολη, Sevastoupoli''}}, old-fashioned ''Σεβαστούπολις, Sevastoupolis''), or currently Sevastopol, was originally chosen in the same [[Etymology|etymological]] trend as other cities in the Crimean peninsula that was intended to reflect its ancient Greek origins. It is a compound of two Greek nouns, {{Polytonic|σεβαστός}} (''sebastós'', Modern ''sevastós'') "venerable, reverend" and {{Polytonic|πόλις}} (''pólis'') "city". {{Polytonic|Σεβαστός}} is the traditional Greek translation of the honourable Roman title ''Augustus'' "venerable, august", originally given to the first emperor of the Roman Empire, [[Augustus|G. Julius Caesar Octavianus]] and later awarded as a title to his successors (see [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]).

Despite its Greek origin, the name is not old. The city was probably named after the Empress (= "[[Augustus (honorific)|Augusta]]") [[Catherine II]] of [[Russia]] who founded Sevastopol in 1783. She visited the city in 1787 accompanied by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign dignitaries. 
In the west of the city there are well-preserved ruins of an ancient Greek port city '''[[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]''' founded in the 5th c. BC. The name means "peninsula" reflecting its location and is not related to the ancient Greek name for the Crimean Peninsula, ''Chersonēsos [[Taurica|Taurikē]]'' ("the [[Tauri]]an Peninsula").

==Orthography and pronunciation of the name==

* In English, the current prevalent spelling of the name is ''Sevastopol''. The spelling ''Sebastopol'' was also formerly used. In English it is {{pron-en|ˌsɛvəˈstoʊpəl}} or {{IPA|/səˈvæstəpoʊl/}}.
* {{lang-uk/ru|Севастополь}}, {{pronounced|seβ̞ɑsˈtɔpɔlʲ}} in Ukrainian and {{IPA-ru|sʲɪvɐsˈtopəlʲ|}} in Russian.
* {{lang-crh|Aqyar}}
* {{lang-tr|Akyar ''and'' Sivastopol}}

==Sights and monuments==
[[Image:Sevastopl view 2.jpg|thumb|View of Sevastopol and the North Shore.]]

After [[World War II]], Sevastopol was entirely rebuilt. Many top architects and civil engineers from Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and  other cities and thousands of workers from all parts of the USSR took part in the rebuilding process which was mostly finished by the mid-1950s. The downtown core situated on a peninsula between two narrow inlets, South Bay and Artillery Bay, features mostly Mediterranean-style, three-story residential buildings with columned balconies and Venetian-style arches, with retail and commercial spaces occupying the ground level. Some carefully restored landmarks date back to the early 20th c. (e.g., the Art Nouveau Main Post Office on Bolshaya Morskaya St and the Art Museum on Nakhimovsky Prospect). It has been a long-time tradition for the residents of surrounding suburbs to spend summer evenings by coming to the downtown area for a leisurely stroll with their families along the avenues and boulevards encircling the Central Hill, under the famous Sevastopol chestnut trees, and usually ending up on the waterfront with its famous Marine Boulevard. 

Due to its military history, most streets in the city are named after Russian and Soviet military heroes. There are hundreds of monuments and plaques in various parts of Sevastopol commemorating its military past.

==Russian naval base and ownership dispute==
[[Image:Sevastopol, Ukraine.jpg|thumb|[[Astronaut]] photograph of the Sevastopol area.]]

According to the 1997 treaty, the [[Russia]]n [[naval]] [[military base|base]] is declared to be "located in Sevastopol" on the terms of a twenty year renewable lease, following a long diplomatic and political dispute between Russia and the newly independent [[Ukraine]]. At first, Moscow refused to recognize Ukrainian [[sovereignty]] over Sevastopol as well as over the surrounding [[Crimean]] [[oblast]], arguing that the city was never practically integrated into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] due to its military base status.  This claim has been relinquished in the bilateral "Peace & Friendship" treaty, which has confirmed that Sevastopol belongs to Ukraine. A separate treaty establishes the terms of a long-term lease of land and resources in Sevastopol by Russia.

The ex-Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]] with all its facilities was divided between Russia's Black Sea Fleet and the [[Ukrainian Navy]] after a continuous, sometimes violent struggle. The two navies now co-use some of the city's [[harbour]]s and piers, while others were demilitarised or used by either country. Sevastopol remains the home of the Russian Black Sea Fleet [[Headquarters]] with the Ukrainian Naval [[Headquarters|HQ]] also based in the city. A judicial row continues over the naval [[hydrographic office|hydrographic]] infrastructure both in Sevastopol and on the Crimean coast (especially [[lighthouse]]s historically maintained by the Soviet/Russian Navy and also used for civil [[navigation]] support).

The status of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] has a strong influence over the city's business and cultural life. The Russian society in general and even some outspoken government representatives have never accepted the loss of Sevastopol, and tend to regard it as temporarily separated from the homeland.<ref>[http://ua.pravda.com.ua/news/2007/2/21/54793.htm Pravda.com.ua] (in Ukrainian)</ref> Moscow [[Mayor]] [[Yuriy Luzhkov]] declared that Sevastopol "should again be a Russian city" and appropriated $34 million for "the support of compatriots abroad."<ref name="Aron"> [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122100831438617621.html?mod=hps_us_at_glance_opinion  Russia's Next Target Could Be Ukraine] by Leon Aron, [[Wall Street Journal]], September 10, 2008 </ref> Protests by citizens of the city caused the cancellation of a joint Ukraine-[[NATO]] military exercise in 2006.<ref name="Aron"/>

The current [[President of Ukraine|President]] and [[Ukrainian government]] have no intention of renewing the Russian naval leasehold supporting the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and the Crimea.<ref name=Iht2009-01-09>
