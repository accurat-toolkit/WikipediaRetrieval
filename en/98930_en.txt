'''Eric John Ernest Hobsbawm''', [[Companion of Honour|CH]], FBA, (born 9 June 1917) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[historical materialism|Marxist historian]] and [[author]], one of the most influential British historians of the late twentieth century.

==Life==
Hobsbawm was born in 1917 in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], to Leopold Percy Obstbaum and Nelly Grün, both [[Jewish]], and he grew up in [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]]. A clerical error at birth altered his surname from Obstbaum to Hobsbawm.<ref name="grd">Maya Jaggi. [http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/artsandhumanities/story/0,12241,791760,00.html "A question of faith," ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 September, 2002]</ref> Although the family lived in [[German language|German]]-speaking [[German-speaking Europe|countries]], his parents spoke to him and his younger sister Nancy in [[English language|English]].
His father died in 1929, and he started working as an [[au pair]] and English [[tutor]]. He became an [[orphan]] at age 14 upon the death of his mother. Subsequently, he and Nancy were adopted by his maternal aunt, Gretl, and paternal uncle, Sidney, who married and had a son, also named Eric. They all moved to [[London]] in 1933.

Hobsbawm married twice. His first wife was Muriel Seaman, whom he married in 1943 and divorced in 1951. His second marriage was to Marlene Schwartz, with whom he has two children, [[Julia Hobsbawm]] and [[Andy Hobsbawm]]. Julia is chief executive of Hobsbawm Media and Marketing and a visiting professor of [[public relations]] at the [[London College of Communication|College of Communication]], [[University of the Arts London]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/my-life-in-media-julia-hobsbawm-530996.html|title=My Life In Media: Julia Hobsbawm|date=2005-04-04|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantic-books.co.uk/our_writers/browse_authors.asp?css=1&id=4454|title=Julia Hobsbawm|publisher=Atlantic Books|accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> He also has a son, Joshua, from a previous relationship. 

He is a [[Marxism|Marxist]] and was a long-standing member of the now defunct [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and the associated [[Communist Party Historians Group]]. He is president of [[Birkbeck, University of London]]. He was appointed a [[Companion of Honour]] in 1998. In 2003 he was awarded the [[Balzan Prize]] for European History since 1900 "For his brilliant analysis of the troubled history of twentieth-century Europe and for his ability to combine in-depth historical research with great literary talent".

==Politics==
Hobsbawm joined the [[Sozialistischer Schülerbund]] (Association of Socialist Pupils), an offspring of the German [[Communist Youth]] KJVD, in Berlin in 1931 and the [[Communist]] party in 1936, supporting both the [[Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact]] and the Soviet invasion of [[Finland]] in 1939.<ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/thunderer/article460555.ece</ref> He was member of the [[Communist Party Historians Group]] from 1946 to 1956. The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet Invasion of Hungary]] in 1956 marked the end of the Communist Party Historian's Group and led most of its members to remove themselves from the British Communist Party. Hobsbawm, uniquely among his colleagues, remained in the Party, however. Yet he denounced USSR crime and abuses as early as 1956 (''Daily Worker'', November 18, 1956). In the same article he characterized the Polish and the Hungarian uprisings as "revolts of workers and intellectuals against bureaucracies and pseudo-communist political systems".  Writing in the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' in late 1956, Hobsbawm argued that "Whilst approving, with a heavy heart, of what is now happening in Hungary, we should therefore also say frankly that we think the USSR should withdraw its troops from the country as soon as this is possible."<ref>''Daily Worker'', 9 November, 1956</ref>

Later he came to support the [[Eurocommunism|Eurocommunist]] faction in the CPGB. In "The Forward March of Labour Halted?", originally a ''[[Marxism Today]]'' article published in September 1978, he argued that the [[working class]] was inevitably losing its central role in society, and that Left parties could no longer appeal only to this class; a controversial viewpoint in a period of trade union militancy. Hobsbawm supported [[Neil Kinnock]]'s transformation of the [[British Labour Party]] from 1983. Until the cessation of publication in 1991, he contributed to the magazine ''Marxism Today''. Since the 1960s his politics have taken a more moderate turn, as Hobsbawm came to recognize that his hopes were unlikely to be realized, and no longer advocates "socialist systems of the Soviet type".<ref> [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/apr/10/financial-crisis-capitalism-socialism-alternatives Socialism has failed. Now capitalism is bankrupt. So what comes next?]</ref> Yet, he remains firmly entrenched on the left, and thinks the long-term outlooks for humanity are 'bleak'.<ref> [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about_us/publications/bbk/bbk22/history Interview with Eric Hobsbawm on his 90th birthday]</ref><ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/page/0,11915,796418,00.html Eric Hobsbawm: Observer special]</ref><ref>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/HIShobsbawm.htm Article in Spartacus.SchoolNet.co.uk]</ref><ref>[http://www.age-of-the-sage.org/history/historian/Eric_Hobsbawm.html Eric Hobsbawm Marxist historian]</ref><ref>[http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/78_09_hobsbawm.pdf 'The Forward March of Labour Halted?', ''Marxism Today'', September 1978]</ref><ref>[http://www.marxists.de/workmvmt/birchcarl/hobsbawm.htm ''Eric Hobsbawm and the working class''] by Norah Carlin and [[Ian Birchall]] (1983)</ref><ref>[http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,425863,00.html The lion of the Left] 21 January, 2001</ref><ref>[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about_us/publications/bbk/bbk22/history Birkbeck magazine, Living History] Interview with John Crave to mark Hobsbawm's 90th Birthday, September 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.selvesandothers.org/view17.html Eric Hobsbawm, unrepentant communist] 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n02/hobs01_.html Diary, Eric Hobsbawm] 24 January 2008</ref>

==Academic life==
He was educated at Prinz-Heinrich-[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] Berlin, [[St Marylebone Grammar School]] (now defunct) and [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in history on the [[Fabian Society]]. He was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]]. During [[World War II]], he served in the [[Royal Engineers]] and the [[Royal Army Educational Corps]]. 

In 1947, he became a [[lecturer]] in [[history]] at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]] He became reader in 1959, professor between 1970-1982 and an [[Emeritus professor]] of history 1982. He as a fellow between 1949-1955 at [[King's College]], Cambridge.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/sep/14/biography.history</ref>

He was a [[visiting professor]] at [[Stanford]] in the 1960s. In 1970, he was appointed [[professor]] and in 1978 he became a Fellow of the [[British Academy]]. He is an honorary Foreign Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

He retired in 1982 but stayed as [[visiting professor]] at [[The New School for Social Research]] in [[Manhattan]] between 1984-1997. He is currently President of [[Birkbeck, University of London]] and [[Professor Emeritus]] in The New School for Social Research in the [[Political Science]] department. He speaks [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], and reads [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. One of Hobsbawm's interests is the development of [[tradition]]s. His work is a study of their [[Social construction|social construction]] in the context of the [[nation state]]. He argues that many [[traditions]] are invented by national elites to justify the existence and importance of their respective [[nation state]]s.{{fact|date=January 2009}}

==Works==
Hobsbawm has written extensively on many subjects as one of Britain's most prominent historians. As a [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historiographer]] he has focused on analysis of the "dual revolution" (the political [[French revolution]] and the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial British revolution]]). He sees their effect as a driving force behind the predominant trend towards [[liberal capitalism]] today. Another recurring theme in his work has been [[social bandits|social banditry]], a phenomenon that Hobsbawm has tried to place within the confines of relevant societal and historical context thus countering the traditional view of it being a spontaneous and unpredictable form of primitive rebellion.<ref name="grd"/><ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n19/ande01_.html Review of Eric Hobsbawm's memoirs] by [[Perry Anderson]], ''[[London Review of Books]]'', 3 October, 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/21/jan03/hobsbawm.htm Eric Hobsbawm: lying to the credulous ] by [[David Pryce-Jones]], January 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=7315 "Eric Hobsbawm Speaks on His New Memoir"], 5 February, 2004</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalismproject.org/what/hobsbawm.htm Eric Hobsbawm Nations and Nationalism since 1780] 1990</ref><ref>[http://dannyreviews.com/a/Eric_Hobsbawm.html Eric Hobsbawm, Book Reviews] 2001</ref><ref>[http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/hobsbawmsageofextremes.html Low Marx: A Review of Eric Hobsbawm's Age of Extremes]</ref><ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/author/results.pperl?authorid=13171 Radom House author spotlight]</ref>

Outside of his academic historical writing, Hobsbawm has written a regular column (under the pseudonym 'Francis Newton' &ndash; taken from the name of [[Billie Holiday]]'s communist trumpet player, [[William Frank Newton|Frankie Newton]]) for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' as a [[jazz]] critic, and time to time over popular music such as with his "Beatles and before" article. <ref>http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/25548848/Beatles-and-before</ref> He has numerous essays published in various intellectual journals, dealing with anything from [[barbarity]] in the [[modern age]] to the troubles of [[labour movement]]s and the conflict between [[anarchism]] and [[communism]]. His most recent publications are the autobiography, ''Interesting Times'' (2002), ''Globalisation, Democracy and Terrorism'' (2007) and ''On Empire'' (2008).

==Reputation==
Thirty years ago Hobsbawm was described as "arguably our greatest living historian — not only Britain's, but the world's."<ref>''[[The Spectator]],'' quoted on the dust jacket of ''The Age of Capital''.</ref> [[James Joll]] wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that "Eric Hobsbawm's nineteenth century trilogy is one of the great achievements of historical writing in recent decades."<ref>Quoted on the dust jacket of ''The Age of Extremes''.</ref> [[Tony Judt]], director of the Erich Maria Remarque Institute at [[New York University]], believes that Hobsbawm's tendency to disparage any nationalist movement as passing and irrational weakens his grasp of parts of the 20th century. Judt however, also wrote that "Hobsbawm is a cultural folk hero. His fame is well deserved. Hobsbawm doesn't just know more than other historians, he writes better, too."<ref>[http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=7315 "Eric Hobsbawm Speaks on His New Memoir"], ''[[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] International Institute'', 2004</ref> In [[Neal Ascherson]]'s view "Eric's Jewishness increased his sensitivity about nationalism. He's the original happy cosmopolitan, who's benefited from being able to move freely."<ref name="grd"/>

===Public Criticism===
Hobsbawm has attracted criticism for his support for communism, even after the Hungarian and Czechoslovak rebellions against Soviet rule that were put down with such force. Also, [[Robert Conquest]] has claimed that in an interview with [[Canadian]] author and politician [[Michael Ignatieff]] on British television in 1994, Hobsbawm responded to the question of whether 20 million deaths may have been justified if the proposed communist [[utopia]] had been created as a consequence by saying "yes".<ref name=kamm>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3284-1188437,00.html Oliver Kamm, ‘It takes an intellectual to find excuses for Stalinism,’ ''[[The Times]]'' July 23, 2004]</ref> More specifically, Hobsbawm reportedly said that "in a period in which, as you might imagine, mass murder and mass suffering are absolutely universal, the chance of a new world being born in great suffering would still have been worth backing".<ref>Beichman, Arnold. 2003. The Invitational at Columbia. The [[Washington Times]]. Monday, March 31, 2003</ref> He stressed that since the utopia had not been created, the sacrifices were in fact not justified - a point that he also emphasized in his own 1994 book, ''[[Age of Extremes|The Age of Extremes]]'': 
{{blockquote|Still, whatever assumptions are made, the number of direct and indirect victims must be measured in eight rather than seven digits. In these circumstances it does not much matter whether we opt for a "conservative" estimate nearer to ten than to twenty million or a larger figure: none can be anything but shameful and beyond palliation, let alone justification.<ref>E. Hobsbawm, 'The Age of Extremes,' 1994 p. 393, ISBN 0-349-10671-1)</ref>
