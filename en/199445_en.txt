'''Wayne Mark Rooney''' (born 24 October 1985) is an [[English people|English]] [[Association football|footballer]] who currently plays as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] for English [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]].

Rooney began his career with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], joining their youth team at age ten and rising through the ranks. He made his professional debut in 2002 and his first goal made him the youngest goalscorer in Premier League history at the time. He quickly became part of Everton's first team, spending two seasons at the [[Merseyside]] club. Before the start of the 2004&ndash;05 season he moved to Manchester United for £25.6&nbsp;million and became a key member of the first team. Since then, he has won the Premier League three times, the [[UEFA Champions League 2007–08|2007&ndash;08 UEFA Champions League]] and also the [[Football League Cup]].

Rooney made his England debut in 2003 and at [[Euro 2004]] he briefly became the competition's youngest goalscorer. He is frequently selected for the England squad and also featured in the [[2006 World Cup]].

==Early life==
Born on 24 October 1985 in [[Croxteth]], [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], Rooney is the first child of parents of Irish descent <ref>http://www.ancestry.com/facts/rooney-family-history.ashx</ref> Thomas Wayne and Jeanette Marie Rooney (née Morrey).<ref>[http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/(S(rpqgs3itpbzra3jlvoatrany))/Content/Authors/Default.aspx?id=7515&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 harpercollins.co.uk: Wayne Rooney]</ref>{{Dead link|date=July 2008}} He was raised in Croxteth with younger brothers Graeme and [[John Rooney (footballer)|John]],<ref>[http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/0502_graham_rooney.shtml newsoftheworld.co.uk: ''Roo been had'']</ref><ref>[http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1312932,00.html sky.com: ''Rooney's Brother Set To Play For Ireland'']</ref>  and all three attended [[De La Salle School (Liverpool)|De La Salle School]]. Wayne grew up supporting local club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], and his childhood hero was [[Duncan Ferguson]].<ref>{{cite web |date=2008-06-13 |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/webexclusives/105/article.aspx |title= Wayne Rooney Interview |publisher=FourFourTwo |accessdate=2008-06-13 }}</ref>

==Club career==
===Everton===
After excelling for Liverpool Schoolboys and Dynamo Brownwings, Everton signed Rooney on schoolboy terms at the age of ten.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20061024/ai_n16798326 |title=Rooney at 21 |first=Andy |last=Hunter |work=[[The Independent]] |date=2006-10-24}}</ref> He was part of the youth squad, and after scoring in an FA Youth Cup match, he revealed a T-shirt under his jersey that read, ''"Once a Blue, always a Blue."''<ref>{{cite web |date=2005-09-01 |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/players/past/Rooney.asp |title=Everton Past Players: Wayne Rooney |publisher=ToffeeWeb |accessdate=2007-03-22 }}</ref> Since he was under 17 at the time and therefore ineligible for a professional contract, he was playing for [[pound sterling|£]]80 a week and living with his family on one of the country's most deprived [[Council house|council estates]]. 

On 19 October 2002, five days before his 17th birthday, Rooney scored a match-winning goal against reigning league champions [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]; in addition to ending Arsenal's thirty-match unbeaten run,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2317767.stm BBC SPORT | Football | Eng Prem | Rooney ends Arsenal's run<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> it made Rooney the youngest goalscorer in Premier League history, a record that has since been surpassed twice; first by [[James Milner (footballer)|James Milner]] and then by [[James Vaughan (footballer born 1988)|James Vaughan]]. He was named BBC Sports' 2002-03 [[BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year|Young Personality of the Year]].

At the end of the 2003-04 season, Rooney, citing Everton's inability to challenge for European competition (they had finished seventh the previous season and only just missed out on a UEFA Cup place, but in 2003-04 had narrowly avoided relegation and finished 17th), requested a transfer that Everton refused to oblige if the transfer fee was less than £50&nbsp;million. A three-year, £12,000-a-week contract offer from the club was snubbed by Rooney's agent in August 2004, leaving Manchester United and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] to compete for his signature. ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Newcastle were close to signing Rooney for £18.5&nbsp;million, as confirmed by Rooney's agent, but Manchester United ultimately won the bidding war and Rooney signed at the end of the month after a £25.6&nbsp;million deal with Everton was reached.<ref>{{cite web |date=2005-10-11 |url=http://dps.twiihosting.net/manutd/doc/content/doc_10_139.pdf |title=Manchester United plc Report & Accounts 2005 |publisher=Manchester United plc |accessdate=2006-11-16 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref> At the time of the signing, Everton were close to administration and needed money to stay afloat. Fourteen days after Rooney's departure, Everton paid off a £10m loan from [[Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander]] which had been secured in February earlier that year to stave off the administrators.

It was the highest fee ever paid for a player aged under 20. Rooney was still only 18 years old when he left Everton.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3607620.stm |title=Rooney worth the fight |date=2004-08-14 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=2007-02-14}}</ref>

On 1 September 2006, Everton manager [[David Moyes]] sued Rooney for libel after the tabloid newspaper ''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]'' published excerpts from Rooney's [[Wayne_Rooney#Personal_life_|2006 autobiography]] that accused the coach of leaking Rooney's reasons for leaving the club to the press.<ref>{{cite web |author=Paolo Bandini & agencies |title=Rooney book could be pulped|work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2006-09-01 |date=2006-09-01 |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,1862946,00.html}}</ref> The case was settled out of court for £500,000 on 3 June 2008, and Rooney apologized to Moyes for ''"false claims"'' he had made in the book regarding the matter.<ref name="moyes">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2069407/Wayne-Rooney-settles-autobiography-libel-dispute-with-Everton-manager-David-Moyes.html Wayne Rooney settles autobiography libel dispute] - The Telegraph, 6/3/08</ref>

====2004–2009====
[[File:Wayne Rooney (Broken Foot).JPG|thumb|Rooney being treated for his broken foot]]
Rooney made his United debut on 28 September 2004 in a 6-2 [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stage win over [[Fenerbahçe S.K.|Fenerbahçe]], scoring a hat-trick along with an assist.<ref>{{cite news |date=2004-09-28 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/3677174.stm |title=Rooney's debut hat-trick against Fenerbahce |work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> In September 2005, Rooney was [[ejection (sports)|sent off]] in a [[UEFA Champions League]] clash with [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] of [[Spain]] (which ended in a goalless draw) for sarcastically clapping the referee who had booked him for an unintentional foul on an opponent. [http://www.theage.com.au/news/soccer/rooney-clapped-out-fergie-left-fuming/2005/09/15/1126750078545.html] His first trophy with United came in the 2006 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], and he was also named [[man of the match]] after scoring twice in United's 4-0 win over [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the final. In the [[Premier League]], however, an erratic start to the season left title glory looking unlikely for United and their title hopes were ended in late April when they lost 3-0 at home to champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and had to settle for second place.

Rooney was sent off in an [[Amsterdam Tournament]] match against [[F.C. Porto|Porto]] on 4 August 2006 after hitting Porto defender [[Pepe (footballer born 1983)|Pepe]] with an elbow.<ref>{{cite news |date=2006-08-04 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/5247208.stm |title=Rooney & Scholes off in friendly |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> He was punished with a three-match ban by [[The Football Association|the FA]], following their receipt of a 23-page report from referee Ruud Bossen that explained his decision.<ref>{{cite news |date=2006-08-15 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/4796139.stm |title=Rooney & Scholes lose ban appeals|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> Rooney wrote a letter of protest to the FA, citing the lack of punishment handed down to other players who were sent off in friendlies. He also threatened to withdraw the FA's permission to use his image rights if they did not revoke the ban, but the FA had no power to make such a decision.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lawton, James | date=2006-09-19 |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/comment/article1619219.ece |title=James Lawton: What's wrong with Wayne Rooney? |publisher=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2007-09-14}}</ref>

[[File:Wayne Rooney 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rooney playing for Manchester United]]
During the first half of the 2006–07 season, Rooney ended a ten-game scoreless streak with a hat-trick against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]],<ref name="IHT">[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/28/sports/EU_SPT_SOC_English_Roundup.php Rooney hat trick helps Man United to 4-0 win] - International Herald Tribune, 28 October 2006</ref> and he signed a two-year contract extension the next month that tied him to United until 2012. By the end of April, a combination of two goals in an 8-3 aggregate quarter-final win over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and two more in a 3-2 semifinal first leg victory over [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd 3-2 AC Milan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6582631.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2007-04-24 |accessdate=2008-06-07 }}</ref> brought Rooney's total goal amount to 23 in all competitions and tied him with teammate [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] for the team goalscoring lead.

Rooney collected his first [[Premier League]] title winner's medal at the end of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006-07 season]], but has yet to pick up an [[FA Cup]] winner's medal; he had to settle for a runners-up medal in the [[2007 FA Cup Final]]. 

United announced during the post-season that Rooney had taken over the number 10 jersey that was vacated by [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]], who had left for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] a year earlier. He was presented with the shirt at a press conference on 28 June 2007 by former United striker [[Denis Law]], who had also worn the number during his tenure with the club in the [[1960s]] and early [[1970s]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Rooney delighted with new number |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&newsid=440380 |publisher=Manchester United FC |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2007-06-30 }}</ref>

[[File:Wayne Rooney UEFA Champions League.jpg|thumb|upright|Rooney in a Champions League match against Celtic.]]

==International career==
[[File:Wayne Rooney.jpg|200px|thumb|Rooney playing for [[England national football team|England]].]]
Rooney became the youngest player to play for [[England national football team|England]] when he earned his first cap in a friendly against [[Australia national football (soccer) team|Australia]] on 12 February 2003 at seventeen, the same age in which he also became the youngest player to score an England goal. Arsenal youngster [[Theo Walcott]] broke Rooney's appearance record by 36 days in June 2006.

His first tournament action was at [[Euro 2004]], in which he became the youngest scorer in competition history on 17 June 2004, when he scored twice against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]; however, this record was topped by Swiss midfielder [[Johan Vonlanthen]] four days later. Rooney suffered an injury in the quarterfinal match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] as England were eliminated on penalties.

Following a foot injury in an April 2006 Premier League match, Rooney faced a race to fitness for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. England attempted to hasten his recovery with the use of an oxygen tent, which allowed Rooney to enter a group match against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] and start the next match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. However, he never got back into game shape and went scoreless as England bowed out in the quarterfinals, again on penalty kicks. 

Rooney was red-carded in the 62nd minute of the quarterfinal for stomping on Portugal defender [[Ricardo Carvalho]]  as both attempted to gain possession of the ball, an incident that occurred right in front of referee [[Horacio Elizondo]]. Rooney's United teammate [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] openly protested his actions, and was in turn shoved by Rooney. Elizondo sent Rooney off, after which Ronaldo was seen winking at the Portugal bench. Rooney denied intentionally targeting Carvalho in a statement on 3 July, adding, ''"I bear no ill feeling to Cristiano but am disappointed that he chose to get involved. I suppose I do, though, have to remember that on that particular occasion we were not teammates."''<ref>{{cite news |date=2006-07-03 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=373186&cc=5739 |title=Rooney claim: No intent and no ill will |work=[[Soccernet]] |accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> Elizondo confirmed the next day that Rooney was dismissed solely for the infraction on Carvalho.<ref>{{cite news |date=2006-07-04 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=373212&cc=5739 |title=Ronaldo cleared over Rooney red card |work=[[Soccernet]] |accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> Rooney was fined [[Swiss franc|CHF]]5,000 for the incident.<ref>{{cite news |date=2006-07-10 |url=http://worldcup.reuters.co.uk/england/news/usnL08917618.html |title=FIFA hands Rooney two-match ban |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Rooney is [[Roman Catholic]]. He met his wife, [[Coleen Rooney]] (née McLoughlin), while both were in their final year of secondary school. They married on 12 June 2008 after six years of dating, during which Rooney admitted to soliciting prostitution in Liverpool in 2004. '"I was young and stupid. It was at a time when I was very young and immature and before I had settled down with Coleen."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/3588112.stm| title=Rooney admits prostitute visits| publisher=BBC| date=2004-08-22| accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref> He has a tattoo of the words "[[Just Enough Education To Perform]]," the title of an album by his favorite band, the [[Stereophonics]]; Coleen arranged for the group to play at their wedding reception.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nme.com/news/stereophonics/37949| title=Wayne Rooney gets Stereophonics tattoo| publisher=NME.com| date=2008-06-09| accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref> The wedding ran into some controversy with the [[Catholic Church]]. The couple, held a religious ceremony at La Cervara, a converted monastery near [[Genoa]], despite being warned by the local bishop's office against the plan. The bishop's office told the Rooneys that La Cervara is deconsecrated and not suitable for a wedding. It suggested a different church, five miles away. Nevertheless, the couple ignored the advice and Father Edward Quinn, their local priest from [[Croxteth]], presided over a ceremony in which rings were exchanged.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2138867/Wayne-Rooneys-wedding-to-Coleen-McLoughlin-not-valid-says-Catholic-Church.html| title=Wayne Rooney's wedding to Coleen McLoughlin 'not valid', says Catholic Church| publisher=The Telegraph| date=2008-06-16| accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>

In April 2006, he was awarded £100,000 in libel damages from tabloids ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[News of the World]],'' who had claimed that he had assaulted her in a nightclub.

On 9 March 2006, Rooney signed the largest sports book deal in publishing history with [[HarperCollins]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4790978.stm |title=Striker Rooney nets £5m book deal |publisher=BBC |date=2006-03-10 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref> who granted him a £5&nbsp;million advance plus royalties for a minimum of five books to be published over a twelve-year period. The first, ''My Story So Far,'' an autobiography ghostwritten by [[Hunter Davies]], was published after the World Cup. The second publication, ''The Official Wayne Rooney Annual,'' was aimed at the teenage market and edited by football journalist [[Chris Hunt]]. 

In July 2006, Rooney's lawyers went to the [[United Nations]]' [[World Intellectual Property Organisation]] to gain ownership of the Internet domain names ''waynerooney.com'' and ''waynerooney.co.uk'', both of which Welsh actor Huw Marshall registered in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/5207766.stm |title=Rooney's legal fight for website |publisher=BBC |date=2006-07-23 |accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> Three months later, the WIPO awarded Rooney the rights to ''waynerooney.com.''<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_east/6048958.stm |title=Rooney wins his fight for website |publisher=BBC |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

===Paul Stretford controversy===
In July 2002, while Rooney was with Everton, agent [[Paul Stretford]] encouraged Rooney and his parents to enter the player into an eight-year contract with Proactive Sports Management. However, Rooney was already with another representation firm at the time, while Stretford's transaction went unreported to the FA, and he was thus charged with improper conduct.<ref name="manublog">[http://www.manutdblog.com/2008/07/09/wayne-rooney’s-agent-banned-and-fined/ Wayne Rooney’s agent banned and fined] - Manchester United Blog, 7/9/08</ref> Stretford alleged in his October 2004 trial that he had secretly recorded boxing promoter John Hyland (an associate of Rooney's first agent) and two other men threatening and attempting to blackmail him for an undisclosed percentage of Rooney's earnings.<ref name="telegraph">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/2305232/Wayne-Rooney%27s-agent%2C-Paul-Stretford%2C-banned.html Wayne Rooney's agent, Paul Stretford, banned] - The Telegraph, 7/22/08</ref>

Stretford's case collapsed due to evidence that conflicted with his insistence that he had not signed Rooney, and on 9 July 2008, he was found guilty of  ''"making of false and/or misleading witness statements to police, and giving false and/or misleading testimony."''<ref name="telegraph"/> In addition, the contract to which Stretford had signed Rooney was two years longer than the limit allowed by the FA. Stretford was fined £300,000 and banned from working as a football agent for eighteen months, a verdict he promptly appealed.<ref name="telegraph"/>
