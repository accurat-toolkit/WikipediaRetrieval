'''Europe''' ({{IPA-en|ˈjʊərəp|}}) is, by convention, one of the world's seven [[continent]]s. Comprising the westernmost [[peninsula]] of [[Eurasia]], Europe is generally divided from [[Asia]] to its east by the [[water divide]] of the [[Ural Mountains]], the [[Ural (river)|Ural River]], the [[Caspian Sea]], the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma-Manych Depression]]),<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica">{{cite web|last=Encyclopedia Britannica Online Encyclopedia 2009|title="Europe"|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195686/Europe|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> and the [[Black Sea]] to the southeast.<ref name="NatlGeoAtlas">{{cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=7th|year=1999|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=0-7922-7528-4}}  "Europe" (pp. 68-9); "Asia" (pp. 90-1): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe ... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."</ref>  Europe is bordered by the [[Arctic Ocean]] and other bodies of water to the north, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, and the [[Black Sea]] and connected waterways to the southeast. Yet the borders for Europe—a concept dating back to [[classical antiquity]]—are somewhat arbitrary, as the term ''continent'' can refer to a [[human geography|cultural and political]] distinction or a [[physical geography|physiographic]] one.

Europe is the world's [[Continent#Area and population|second-smallest]] continent by surface [[area]], covering about 10,180,000&nbsp;square kilometres (3,930,000 sq mi) or 2% of the Earth's surface and about 6.8% of its land area. Of Europe's approximately 50 states, [[Russia]] is the largest by both area and population, while the [[Vatican City]] is the smallest. Europe is the third most populous continent after Asia and [[Africa]], with a [[Demographics of Europe|population]] of 731 million or about 11% of the [[World population|world's population]]; however, according to the [[United Nations]] (medium estimate), Europe's share may fall to about 7% by 2050.<ref name="UNPP 2006"/> In 1900, Europe's share of the world's population was 25%.<ref>[http://www.prb.org/Educators/TeachersGuides/HumanPopulation/PopulationGrowth.aspx?p=1 World Population Growth, 1950–2050]. Population Reference Bureau.</ref>

Europe, in particular [[Ancient Greece]], is the birthplace of [[Western culture]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|page=226}}</ref> It played a predominant role in global affairs from the 16th century onwards, especially after the beginning of [[colonialism]]. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European nations controlled at various times [[European colonisation of the Americas|the Americas]], [[Colonisation of Africa|most of Africa]], [[Oceania]], and large portions of [[Asia]]. Both [[World War]]s were ignited in [[Central Europe]], greatly contributing to a decline in European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] took prominence. During the [[Cold War]] Europe was divided along the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[NATO]] in the West and the [[Warsaw Pact]] in the East. [[European integration]] led to the formation of the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Union]] in [[Western Europe]], both of which have been expanding eastward since the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|Europe}}
In ancient [[Greek mythology]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] was a [[Phoenicia]]n princess whom [[Zeus]] abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull. He took her to the island of [[Crete]] where she gave birth to [[Minos]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and [[Sarpedon]]. For [[Homer]], Europe ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Εὐρώπη}}, ''{{Unicode|Eurṓpē}}''; see also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]) was a mythological queen of Crete, not a geographical designation. Later, ''Europa'' stood for [[Geography of Greece|central-north Greece]], and by 500 BC its meaning had been extended to the lands to the north.

The name of ''Europa'' is of uncertain etymology.<ref>Minor theories, such as the (probably folk-etymological) one deriving Europa from ''ευρως'' "mould" aren't discussed in the section</ref> One theory suggests that it is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek roots]] meaning broad (''eur-'') and eye (''op-'', ''opt-''), hence ''{{Unicode|Eurṓpē}}'', "wide-gazing", "broad of aspect" (compare with [[Athena#Cult and attributes|''glauk'''ōp'''is'' (grey-eyed) Athena]] or [[Hera|''bo'''ōp'''is'' (ox-eyed) Hera]]). ''Broad'' has been an [[epithet]] of [[Earth]] itself in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].<ref>{{cite book |author=M. L. West |title=Indo-European poetry and myth |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2007 |pages=178–179 |isbn=0-19-928075-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Another theory suggests that it is actually based on a [[Semitic]] word such as the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''erebu'' meaning "to go down, set" (cf. [[Occident]]),<ref name="Etymonline: European">{{cite web| url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=European| title=Etymonline: European| accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> [[cognate]] to Phoenician '' 'ereb'' "evening; west" and Arabic [[Maghreb]], Hebrew ''ma'ariv'' (see also ''[[Erebus]]'', [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*h<sub>1</sub>regʷos'', "darkness"). However, M. L. West states that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor".<ref>{{cite book |author=M. L. West |title=The east face of Helicon: west Asiatic elements in Greek poetry and myth |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1997 |pages=451 |isbn=0-19-815221-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Most major world languages use words derived from "Europa" to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word ''{{Unicode|Ōuzhōu}}'' (歐洲), which is an abbreviation of the transliterated name ''{{Unicode|Ōuluóbā zhōu}}'' (歐羅巴洲); however, in some [[Turkic languages]] the name ''Frengistan'' (land of the [[Franks]]) is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as ''Avrupa'' or ''Evropa''.<ref name="davison">{{cite journal |author=Davidson, Roderic H. |title=Where is the Middle East? |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38 |pages=665–675 |year=1960}}</ref>

[[File:Rolandfealty.jpg|thumb|right|[[Roland]] pledges [[fealty]] to [[Charlemagne]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]].]]
During the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the "[[Age of Migrations]]". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Huns]], [[Franks]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and, later still, the [[Vikings]] and [[Normans]].<ref name = "mieawl"/> Renaissance thinkers such as [[Petrarch]] would later refer to this as the "[[Dark Ages]]".<ref>, ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1. (Jan., 1943), pp. 69–74. </ref> Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Europe.<ref>[[Norman Cantor|Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Medieval World 300 to 1300''.</ref>

During the Dark Ages, the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell under the control of Celtic, Slavic and Germanic tribes. The Celtic tribes established their kingdoms in [[Gaul]], the predecessor to the Frankish kingdoms that eventually became [[France]].<ref name="natgeo 140">National Geographic, 140</ref> The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Central and Eastern Europe respectively.<ref name="natgeo 143">National Geographic, 143–145.</ref> Eventually the [[Franks|Frankish tribes]] were united under [[Clovis&nbsp;I]].<ref name="natgeo 162">National Geographic, 162.</ref> [[Charlemagne]], a Frankish king of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed "Holy Roman Emperor" by the Pope in 800. This led to the founding of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.<ref name="natgeo 166">National Geographic, 166.</ref>

The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] became known in the west as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Its capital was [[Constantinople]]. Emperor [[Justinian I]] presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a [[Code of Justinian|legal code]], funded the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]] and brought the Christian church under state control.<ref name="natgeo 135">National Geographic, 135.</ref> Fatally weakened by the sack of Constantinople during the [[Fourth Crusade]], the Byzantines fell in 1453 when they were conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="natgeo 211">National Geographic, 211.</ref>

[[File:Richard3.jpg|thumbnail|left| [[Richard I]] and [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], during the [[Third Crusade]]]]
The Middle Ages were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. Feudalism developed in [[France]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]] and soon spread throughout Europe.<ref name="natgeo 158">National Geographic, 158.</ref> The struggle between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the [[Magna Carta]] and the establishment of a [[parliament]].<ref name="natgeo 186">National Geographic, 186.</ref> The primary source of culture in this period came from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.<ref name="natgeo 158"/>

The [[Papacy]] reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. The [[East-West Schism]] in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|crusade]] against [[Muslims]] occupying [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]].<ref name="natgeo 192">National Geographic, 192.</ref> In Europe itself, the Church organised the [[Inquisition]] against heretics.

Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]]. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in [[Avignon]] and one in [[Rome]]—claimed rulership over the Church.

Two World Wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. [[World War I]] was fought between 1914 and 1918.

Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s.

In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the [[Saarland]] and [[Rhineland]] in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, [[Austria]] became a part of Germany too, following the [[Anschluss]]. Later that year, Germany annexed the German [[Sudetenland]], which had become a part of [[Czechoslovakia]] after the war. This move was highly contested by the other powers, but ultimately permitted in the hopes of avoiding war and [[appeasement|appeasing]] Hitler. Shortly afterwards, Poland and Hungary started to press for the annexation of parts of Czechoslovakia with Polish and Hungarian majorities. Hitler encouraged the Slovaks to do the same and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], controlled by Germany, and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]], while other smaller regions went to Poland and Hungary. With tensions mounting between Germany and Poland over the future of [[Danzig]], the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed an important [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|pact]]. Germany [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September.<ref name="natgeo 465">National Geographic, 465.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=A.J.P.|title= The Origins of the Second World War|date=1996|publisher=Simon & Schuster| isbn=0684829479}}</ref> The [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter.

On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic countries]] and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at Narvik and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Nevertheless, the Germans knew of Britain's plans and got to Narvik first, repulsing the attack. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark, which left no room for a front except for where the last war had been fought or by landing at sea. The [[Phoney War]] continued.

In May 1940, Germany attacked France through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. However, the British refused to negotiate peace terms with the Germans and the war continued. By August, Germany began a [[Battle of Britain|bombing offensive on Britain]], but failed to convince the Britons to give up.<ref name="natgeo 510">National Geographic, 510.</ref> In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the ultimately unsuccessful [[Operation Barbarossa]].<ref name="natgeo 532">National Geographic, 532.</ref> On 7 December 1941 [[Empire of Japan|Japan's]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the [[British Empire]] and other [[Allies of World War II|allied]] forces.<ref name="natgeo 511">National Geographic, 511.</ref><ref name="natgeo 519">National Geographic, 519.</ref> After the staggering [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback.

World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the [[Yalta Conference]] and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the [[communist]] Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by [[Winston Churchill]] an "[[iron curtain]]".

[[File:Kaukasus.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of [[Caucasus Mountains]], [[Black Sea]] (l.) and [[Caspian Sea]] (r.)]]
[[Physical geography|Physiographically]], Europe is the northwestern constituent of the larger landmass known as [[Eurasia]], or [[Afro-Eurasia]]: [[Asia]] occupies the eastern bulk of this continuous landmass and all share a common [[continental shelf]]. Europe's eastern frontier is now commonly delineated by the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[Russia]].<ref name="Encarta"/> The first century AD geographer [[Strabo]], took the [[Don River (Russia)|River Don]] "''Tanais''" to be the boundary to the [[Black Sea]]<ref>Strabo ''Geography 11.1''</ref>, as did early [[Judea|Judaic]] sources. The southeast boundary with Asia is not universally defined. Most commonly the [[Ural River|Ural]] or, alternatively, the [[Emba River]] serve as possible boundaries. The boundary continues to the [[Caspian Sea]], the crest of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] or, alternatively, the [[Kura River]] in the [[Caucasus]], and on to the [[Black Sea]]; the [[Bosporus]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Dardanelles]], and the [[Aegean Sea]] conclude the Asian boundary. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south separates Europe from [[Africa]]. The western boundary is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[Iceland]], though nearer to [[Greenland]] ([[North America]]) than mainland Europe, is generally included in Europe.

Because of sociopolitical and cultural differences, there are various descriptions of Europe's boundary; in some sources, some territories are not included in Europe, while other sources include them. For instance, geographers from [[Post-Soviet states|Russia and other post-Soviet states]] generally include the Urals in Europe while including Caucasia in Asia. Similarly, numerous geographers{{Who|date=December 2008}} consider [[Azerbaijan]]'s and [[Armenia]]'s southern borders with [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]'s southern and eastern borders with [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and Iran as the boundary between Asia and Europe because of political and cultural reasons.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Similarly, [[Cyprus]] is approximate to [[Anatolia|Anatolia (or Asia Minor)]], but is often considered part of Europe and currently is a member state of the [[European Union|EU]].  In addition, Malta was considered an island of [[Africa]] for centuries.<ref>Falconer, William; Falconer, Thomas.

===Physical geography===
[[File:Europe topography map en.png|thumb|right|Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions]]
Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions, however, are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]] and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the [[Great European Plain]], and at its heart lies the [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], and then continues along the mountainous, [[fjord]]-cut, spine of [[Norway]].

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [[Iceland]], Britain and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.

]]

Europe lies mainly in the [[temperate]] climate zones, being subjected to [[prevailing westerlies]].

The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]].<ref name=climate>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight/climates/european_climate|title=European Climate|work=World Book|accessdate=2008-06-16|publisher=World Book, Inc}}</ref> The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.

Therefore the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16&nbsp;°C (60.8&nbsp;°F), while it is only 12&nbsp;°C (53.6&nbsp;°F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8&nbsp;°C (15&nbsp;°F) higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost 22&nbsp;°C (40&nbsp;°F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.<ref name=climate/>

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of Europe}}
The Geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of [[Hungary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|title=Geology map of Europe|year=1967|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from the [[British Isles]] in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the [[British Isles]]. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex and [[Barents Sea]].

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]], and so may be regarded geologically as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of [[Western Europe]] existed as part of the ancient [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].

===Geological history===
{{Main|geological history of Europe}}
The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the [[Baltic Shield]] (Fennoscandia) and the [[Sarmatian craton]], both around 2.25 billion years ago, followed by the [[Volgo-Uralia]] shield, the three together leading to the [[East European craton]] (≈ [[Baltica]]) which became a part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]]. Around 1.1 billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550 million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440 million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190 million years ago, Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia ([[North America]]) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50 million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as [[Asia]]. Europe's present shape dates to the late [[Tertiary period]] about five million years ago.<ref name="encyclopedia britannica">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055|title=Europe|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>

==Biodiversity==

[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|right|300px|Floristic regions of Europe and neighboring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch]]

Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern [[Russia]], few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.

The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.

Probably eighty to ninety per cent of Europe was once covered by forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&geography.htm|title=History and geography|publisher=Save America's Forest Funds|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref> It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Though over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, in European Russia 5–10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area (excluding the [[micronations]]) is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is [[Finland]] (77%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf|title=State of Europe's Forests 2007: The MCPFE report on sustainable forest management in Europe|publisher=EFI Euroforest Portal|pages=182|accessdate=2008-06-09|format=PDF}}</ref>

In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and [[pinophyta|coniferous]] trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the [[taiga]] is a mixed [[spruce]]–[[pine]]–[[birch]] forest; further north within [[Russia]] and extreme northern [[Scandinavia]], the [[taiga]] gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends eastwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern [[Russia]] and ends in [[Hungary]] and traverses into [[taiga]] to the north.

[[Image:Hoehlenloewe CaveLion hharder.jpg|thumb|[[Cave lion]] became extinct in southeastern Europe about 2,000 years ago]]

Glaciation during the most recent [[ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bears]] ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Russia]]; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], a [[Norway|Norwegian]] archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] ([[Scandinavia]], [[Spain]], etc.).

[[Image:Wisent.jpg|thumb|Once roaming the great temperate forests of Eurasia, [[European bison]] now lives in nature preserves in Poland, Russia, and other parts of Eastern Europe]]

Other important European carnivores are [[Eurasian lynx]], European [[wild cat]], [[fox]]es (especially the [[red fox]]), [[jackal]] and different species of [[marten]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, different species of [[List of European reptiles|reptiles]] (like [[snakes]] such as [[Viperinae|vipers]] and [[grass snake]]s) and [[List of European amphibians|amphibians]], different [[List of European birds|birds]] ([[owl]]s, [[hawk]]s and other [[birds of prey]]).

Important European [[herbivore]]s are [[snail]]s, [[larva]]e, [[fish]], different birds, and [[List of European mammals|mammals]], like [[rodent]]s, [[deer]] and [[roe deer]], [[boar]]s, and living in the mountains, [[marmot]]s, [[Alpine Ibex|steinbocks]], [[chamois]] among others.

The extinction of the [[Cretan Dwarf Hippopotamus|dwarf hippos]] and [[dwarf elephant]]s has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the [[Mediterranean]].

Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly [[phytoplankton]]. Important animals that live in European seas are [[zooplankton]], [[mollusc]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, different [[crustacean]]s, [[squid]]s and [[octopuses]], fish, [[dolphin]]s, and [[whales]].

Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention]], which has also been signed by the [[European Community]] as well as non-European states.

Since the [[Renaissance]], Europe has had a major influence in culture, economics and social movements in the world. The most significant [[invention]]s had their origins in
the Western world, primarily Europe and the United States.<ref>[http://corporate.britannica.com/press/inventions.html Encyclopædia Britannica's Great Inventions], Encyclopædia Britannica</ref> Some current and past issues in European demographics have included [[Emigration|religious emigration]], [[race relations]], [[Immigration#Why do people immigrate?|economic immigration]], a declining [[birth rate]] and an [[aging population]]. In some countries, such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Poland]], access to [[abortion]] is currently limited; in the past, such restrictions and also restrictions on artificial birth control were commonplace throughout Europe. Abortion remains illegal on the island of [[Malta]] where [[Catholicism]] is the state religion. Furthermore, three European countries ([[The Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]]) and the [[Autonomous Community]] of [[Andalusia]] (Spain)<ref>[http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/384485/ "Andalucía permitirá por ley la eutanasia pasiva para enfermos incurables"], ''20 Minutos''. 31 May 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=13065 "Andalusia euthanasia law unnecessary, expert warns"], Catholic News Agency. 26 Jun 2008</ref> have allowed a limited form of [[voluntary euthanasia]] for some terminally ill people.

In 2005 the population of Europe was estimated to be 731 million according to the [[United Nations]],<ref name="UNPP 2006"/> which is slightly more than one-ninth of the [[world]]'s population. A century ago Europe had nearly a quarter of the [[world population|world's population]].

''Journal for Maritime Research.''</ref> Today, large populations of European descent are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in [[North America]], and to a lesser degree in [[South America]] (particularly in [[Argentinia]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and southern [[Brazil]]). Also, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]  have large European derived populations. [[Africa]] has no countries with European-derived majorities, but there are significant minorities, such as the [[White South African]]s. In [[Asia]], European-derived populations (specifically [[Russians]])  predominate in [[Northern Asia]].

==Economy==

[[File:Europe gdp real growth rate - 2007.PNG|thumb|GDP real growth rate in 2007]]
{{Main|Economy of Europe}}

As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7 trillion compared to  North America's $27.1 trillion<ref>http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=aL5a46f2RjVA</ref>. As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the [[Western Europe|West]], some of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] economies are still emerging from the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. The [[European Union]], an intergovernmental body composed of 27 European states, comprises the [[List of countries by GDP|largest single economic area]] in the world. Currently, 15 EU [[Eurozone|countries]] share the [[euro]] as a common currency.
Five European countries rank in the top ten of the worlds largest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|national economies in GDP (PPP)]]. This includes (ranks according to the [[The CIA World Factbook|CIA]]): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html|title=[[The CIA World Factbook]] – GDP (PPP)|date=2008-07-15|accessdate=2008-07-19|publisher=[[CIA]]}}</ref>

===Pre–1945: Industrial growth===
[[Capitalism]] has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism Capitalism]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''</ref> From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.<ref>{{cite book|title=Industrialism: A Dictionary of Sociology|author=Scott, John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005}}</ref> The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in Europe, specifically the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 18th century,<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|publisher=The History Guide|author=Steven Kreis|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by [[World War I]] but by the beginning of [[World War II]] they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the [[United States]]. [[World War II]], again, damaged much of Europe's industries.

===1945–1990: The Cold War===
After World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,<ref>Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', pg. 117</ref> and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rethinking International Organization: Deregulation and Global Governance|last=Emadi-Coffin|first=Barbara|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415195403|pages=64}}</ref> [[Italy]] was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. [[West Germany]] [[Wirtschaftswunder|recovered quickly]] and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.<ref>Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', pg. 29</ref> [[France]] also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on [[Spain]], under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the [[Spanish miracle]].<ref>Harrop, Martin. ''Power and Policy in Liberal Democracies'', pg. 23</ref> The majority of [[Eastern Europe]]an states came under the control of the [[USSR]] and thus were members of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON).<ref name=loc-cs>"Germany (East)", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]</ref>
The states which retained a [[free-market]] system were given a large amount of aid by the [[United States]] under the [[Marshall Plan]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/marshallplan|title=Marshall Plan|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the [[EU]] and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the [[Cold War]]. Until 1990, the [[European Community]] was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the [[UK]] as Europe's largest economy.
[[File:RF NG pipestoEU.gif|thumb|upright|160px|[[Russia]] is Europe's key [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] supplier.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,562248,00.html The City Built on Oil: EU-Russia Summit Visits Siberia's Boomtown], Spiegel</ref>]]

===1991–2007: The rise of the EU===
With the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in 1991 the Eastern states had to adapt to a free market system. There were varying degrees of success with [[Central Europe]]an countries such as [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and [[Slovenia]] adapting reasonably quickly, while eastern states like [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]] taking far longer. Western Europe helped Eastern Europe by forming economic ties with it. After [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany. [[Yugoslavia]] lagged farthest behind as it was ravaged by war and in 2003 there were still many [[EU]] and [[NATO]] peacekeeping troops in [[Kosovo]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], with only [[Slovenia]] making any real progress.
By the millennium change, the [[EU]] dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]]. In 1999 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the [[Eurozone]] replacing their former national currencies by the common [[euro]]. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the [[United Kingdom]], [[Denmark]], and [[Sweden]].

===2008–2009: Recession===
{{Main|Late 2000s recession in Europe}}
The [[eurozone]] entered its first official [[recession]] in the third quarter of 2008, official figures confirmed in January 2009.<ref>[http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1231409822.27/ EU data confirms eurozone's first recession].

==Language==
[[File:Simplified Languages of Europe map.svg|thumb|250px|right|Simplified linguistic map within the Council of Europe nations]]
{{Main|Languages of Europe}}
European languages mostly fall within three [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language groups: the [[Romance languages]], derived from the [[Latin language]] of the [[Roman Empire]]; the [[Germanic languages]], whose ancestor language came from southern [[Scandinavia]]; and the [[Slavic languages]].<ref name="encyclopedia britannica"/> While having much of its vocabulary descended from Romance languages, the [[English language]] is a Germanic language.

Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as well as in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]. Germanic languages are spoken in north-western Europe and some parts of [[Central Europe]]. Slavic languages are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe.<ref name="encyclopedia britannica"/>

Many other languages outside the three main groups exist in Europe. Other Indo-European languages include the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] group (i.e., [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), the [[Celtic language|Celtic]] group (i.e., [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]]<ref name="encyclopedia britannica"/>), [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]{{Dubious|date=December 2008}}. A distinct group of [[Uralic languages]] are [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], spoken in the respective countries as well as in parts of Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Slovakia. Other Non-Indo-European languages are [[Maltese language|Maltese]] (the only [[Semitic language]] official to the EU), [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], and languages of minority nations in Russia.

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The [[Council of Europe]] [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

==Religion==
[[File:Europe religion map en.png|thumb|250px|Predominant religions in Europe and neighboring regions:

]]
{{Main|Religion in Europe}}

[[history of religion|Historically]], [[religion]] in Europe has been a major influence on [[Western art history|European art]], [[culture of Europe|culture]], [[Western philosophy|philosophy]] and [[European Union law|law]]. The majority religion in Europe is [[Christianity]] as practiced by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Churches. Following these is [[Islam]] concentrated mainly in the south east ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[TRNC|North Cyprus]], [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]]). Other religions including [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are minority religions. Europe is a relatively secular continent and has the largest number and proportion of [[irreligion|irreligious]], [[agnosticism|agnostic]] and [[atheism|atheistic]] people in the [[Western religion|Western world]], with a particularly high number of self-described non-religious people in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]] (East), and [[France]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dogan|first=Mattei|year=1998|title=The Decline of Traditional Values in Western Europe|journal=International Journal of Comparative Sociology|publisher=Sage|volume=39|pages=77–90|doi=10.1177/002071529803900106}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Europe}}
The culture of Europe can be described as a series of overlapping cultures; cultural mixes exist across the continent. There are cultural [[innovation]]s and movements, sometimes at odds with each other. Thus the question of "common culture" or "common values" is complex.
