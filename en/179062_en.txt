'''Gelsenkirchen''' ({{IPA-de|ˌɡɛlzənˈkɪʁçən}}) is a city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. It is located in the northern part of the [[Ruhr area]]. Its population in 2006 was c. 267,000.

Gelsenkirchen was first documented in 1150, but it remained a tiny village until the 19th century, when the [[Industrial Revolution]] led to the growth of the entire area. In 1840, when the mining of [[coal]] began, 6000 inhabitants lived in Gelsenkirchen; in 1900 the population had increased to 138,000.

In the early 20th century Gelsenkirchen was the most important coal mining town in Europe. It was called the "city of a thousand fires", for the flames of mine gasses being flared during the nights. In 1928 Gelsenkirchen was merged with the adjoining cities of [[Buer, Germany|Buer]] and [[Horst, Germany|Horst]]. The city bore the name '''Gelsenkirchen-Buer''', until it was renamed Gelsenkirchen in 1930. During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] Gelsenkirchen remained a centre of coal production and [[oil refining]], and for this reason it was bombed by Allied air raids in [[World War II]]. During the war, it was the site of a women's subcamp of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]].<ref>Edward Victor. ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.''www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List %20 of %20 camps. htm.</ref> Today in Gelsenkirchen there are no collieries any more and Gelsenkirchen is searching for a new image, having been hit for decades with one of the highest unemployment rates of Germany. Today Germany's largest [[solar power]] plant is located in the city. In Gelsenkirchen-Scholven there is a coal fired power station with the tallest chimneys in Germany (302 m). Gelsenkirchen is home of the famous [[Association football|football]] club [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], which is named after the borough Schalke, while the club's arena - the [[Veltins-Arena]] - is located in the borough [[Erle]].

== History ==
===Ancient and Medieval times===
Although the part of town now called Buer was first mentioned by Heribert I in a document as ''Puira'' in 1003, there were hunting people on a hill north of the [[Emscher]] as early as the [[Bronze Age]] &mdash; and therefore earlier than 1000 BC. They did not live in houses as such, but in small yards gathered together near each other. Later, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] pushed into the area. In about 700, the region was settled by the [[Saxons]]. A few other parts of town which today lie in Gelsenkirchen's north end were mentioned in documents from the early [[Middle Ages]], some examples being: ''Raedese'' (nowadays ''Resse''), Middelvic (''Middelich'', today part of Resse), ''Sutheim'' (''Sutum''; today part of Beckhausen) and ''Sculven'' (nowadays ''Scholven''). Many nearby [[farming]] communities were later identified as ''iuxta Bure'' ("near Buer").

It was about 1150 when the name ''Gelstenkerken'' or ''Geilistirinkirkin'' cropped up for the first time. At about the same time, the first [[Church (building)|church]] in town was built in what is now Buer. This ''ecclesia Buron'' ("church at Buer") was listed in a directory of [[parish]] churches by the sexton from [[Deutz]], Theodericus. This settlement belonged to the [[Mark (county)|Mark]]. However, in [[ancient times]] and even in the Middle Ages, only a few dozen people actually lived in the settlements around the Emscher basin.

===Industrialisation===
Up until the middle of the 19th century, the area in and around Gelsenkirchen was only thinly settled and almost exclusively agrarian. In 1815, after temporarily belonging to the [[Grand Duchy]] of [[Berg (German region)|Berg]], the land now comprising the city of Gelsenkirchen passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which assigned it to the [[province of Westphalia]]. Whereas the Gelsenkirchen of that time &mdash; not including today's north-end communities, such as Buer &mdash; was put in the ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|Amt]]'' of [[Wattenscheid]] in the [[Bochum (district)|Bochum district]], in the governmental [[Arnsberg (region)|region of Arnsberg]], Buer, which was an ''Amt'' in its own right, was along with nearby Horst joined to [[Recklinghausen (district)|Recklinghausen district]] in the governmental [[Münster (region)|region of Münster]]. This arrangement came to an end only in 1928.

After the discovery of [[coal]] &mdash; lovingly known as "Black Gold" &mdash; in the [[Ruhr area]] in 1840, and the subsequent [[industrialization]], the [[Cologne]]-[[Minden]] [[Railway]] and the Gelsenkirchen Main Railway Station were opened. In 1868, Gelsenkirchen became the seat of an ''Amt'' within the Bochum district which encompassed the communities of Gelsenkirchen, Braubauerschaft (as of 1900, Bismarck), Schalke, Heßler, Bulmke and Hüllen.

[[Friedrich Grillo]] founded the Corporation for Chemical Industry (''Aktiengesellschaft für Chemische Industrie'') in Schalke in 1872, and also the Schalke Mining and Ironworks Association (''Schalker Gruben- und Hüttenverein''). A year later, and once again in Schalke, he founded the Glass and Mirror Factory Incorporated (''Glas- und Spiegel-Manufaktur AG'').

After Gelsenkirchen had become an important heavy-industry hub, it was raised to city in 1875.

===Gelsenkirchen becomes a city===
In 1885, after Bochum district was split up, Gelsenkirchen became the seat of its own district (''Kreis''), which would last until 1926. The cities of Gelsenkirchen and Wattenscheid, as well as the [[Amt (administrative division)|Ämter]] of Braubauerschaft (as of 1900, [[Bismarck#Places|Bismarck]]), Schalke, Ückendorf, [[Wanne-Eickel|Wanne]] and [[Wattenscheid]] all belonged to the Gelsenkirchen district. A few years later, in 1896, Gelsenkirchen was split away from Gelsenkirchen district to become an [[independent city]] ({{lang-de|kreisfreie Stadt}}). In 1891, Horst was split away from the ''Amt'' of Buer, which itself was raised to city in 1911, and to an independent city the next year. Meanwhile, Horst became the seat of its own ''Amt''. In 1924, the rural community of [[Flugwerk Deutschland GmbH|Rotthausen]], which until then had belonged to the [[Essen (disambiguation)|Essen district]], was made part of the Gelsenkirchen district.

In 1928, under the Prussian local government reforms, the cities of Gelsenkirchen and Buer along with the ''Amt'' of Horst together became a new ''kreisfreie Stadt'' called Gelsenkirchen-Buer, effective as of [[1 April]] that year. From that time, the whole city area belonged to the governmental district of Münster. In 1930, on the city's advice, the city's name was changed to ''Gelsenkirchen'', effective [[21 May]]. By this time, the city was home to about 340,000 people.

In 1931, the Gelsenkirchen Mining Corporation ({{lang-de|Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-Aktien-Gesellschaft}}) founded the Gelsenberg Petrol Corporation ({{lang-de|Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG}}).  In 1935, the Hibernia Mining Company founded the ''Hydrierwerk Scholven AG GE-Buer'' [[hydrogenation]] plant.  Scholven/Buer began operation in 1936 and achieved a capacity of "''200,000 tons/year of finished product, mainly aviation base gasoline.''".[http://www.fischer-tropsch.org/Bureau_of_Mines/info_circ/ic_7375/ic_7375.htm]  After 1937, Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG opened the Nordstern plant for converting bituminous coal to synthetic oil.<ref name=Becker>

===The Third Reich===
The [[Schicksalstag|November 9, 1938]] [[Kristallnacht]] anti-Jewish riots destroyed Jewish businesses, dwellings, and cemeteries, and a [[synagogue]] in Buer and one in downtown Gelsenkirchen.  (A new downtown Gelsenkirchen synagogue was opened on 1 February 2007.)

Gelsenkirchen was a target of [[strategic bombing during World War II]], particularly during the 1943 [[Battle of the Ruhr]] and the [[Oil Campaign of World War II]]. Three quarters of Gelsenkirchen was destroyed{{Fact|date=February 2008}} and many above-ground [[air-raid shelter]]s such as at Hans-Sachs-Haus downtown and the town hall in Buer are in nearly original form.

The [[Gelsenberg Lager]] subcamp of [[KZ Buchenwald]] was established in 1944 to provide [[forced labor]] of about 2000 Hungarian women and girls for Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG. About 150 died during September 1944 bombing raids (shelters and protection ditches was forbidden to them).[http://www.gelsenzentrum.de GELSENZENTRUM Documentationcenter for urban and contemporary history]

From 1933 to 1945, the city's mayor was the appointed [[Nazi]] Carl Engelbert Böhmer. In 1994, the Institute for City History opened the '''[http://www.gelsenkirchen.de/English/tourism/Portrait_of_the_city/City_Guide/The_Art_and_Culture_Trail.asp Documentation centre - Gelsenkirchen under National Socialism]''' ({{lang-de|Dokumentationsstätte "Gelsenkirchen im Nationalsozialismus}}).

===After the war===
On [[17 December]] [[1953]], the ''Kokerei Hassel'' went into operation, billed as Germany's "first new coking plant" since the war. When [[postal code]]s (''Postleitzahlen'') were introduced in 1961, Gelsenkirchen was one of the few cities in [[West Germany]] to be given two codes: Buer was given 466, while Gelsenkirchen got 465. These were in use until [[1 July]] [[1993]]. The "first [[comprehensive school]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]" was opened in 1969. Scholven-Chemie AG (the old hydrogenation plant) merged with Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG to form the new corporation VEBA-Oel AG. In 1987, [[Pope John Paul II]] celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] before 85,000 people at Gelsenkirchen's Parkstadion. The Pope also became an honorary member of [[FC Schalke 04]].

In 1997, the Federal Garden Show (''Bundesgartenschau'' or ''BUGA'') was held on the grounds of the disused Nordstern [[coalmine]] in Horst. In 1999, the last phase of the Emscher Park International Building Exhibition, an undertaking that brought together many cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, was held. [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] was produced at the old Hassel coking works for the last time on [[29 September]] [[1999]]. This marked the shutdown of the last coking plant in Gelsenkirchen, after being a coking town for more than 117 years. In the same year, Shell Solar Deutschland AG took over production of [[photovoltaic]] equipment. On [[28 April]] [[2000]], the Ewald-Hugo colliery closed &mdash; Gelsenkirchen's last colliery. Three thousand coalminers lost their jobs. In 2003, Buer celebrated its thousandth anniversary of first documentary mention, and FC Schalke 04 celebrated on [[4 May]] [[2004]] its hundredth anniversary.

Today, Gelsenkirchen is a centre for sciences, services, and production, with good infrastructure.

Gelsenkirchen presents itself above all as a centre of solar technology. Shell Solar Deutschland GmbH produces solar cells in Rotthausen. Scheuten Solar Technology has taken over its solar panel production. There are other large businesses in town: THS GmbH, Gelsenwasser, [[E.ON|e.on]], BP Gelsenkirchen GmbH, Shell Solar Deutschland GmbH and [[Pilkington]]. According to a study by the Bertelsmann Foundation, Gelsenkirchen is, after [[Leipzig]], [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], Germany's fourth business-friendliest city.

=== Transport ===
Gelsenkirchen lies on Bundes[[autobahn]]en [[Bundesautobahn 2|A 2]], [[Bundesautobahn 40|A 40]], [[Bundesautobahn 42|A 42]] and [[Bundesautobahn 52|A 52]], as well as on Bundesstraßen (Federal Highways) B 224, B 226 and B 227. Gelsenkirchen's main [[railway station]] lies at the [[junction (rail)|junction]] of the [[Oberhausen]]-Gelsenkirchen-[[Herne, Germany|Herne]]-[[Dortmund]] and [[Essen]]-Gelsenkirchen-[[Recklinghausen]]-[[Münster]] lines.

As for [[waterway]]s, Gelsenkirchen can be reached along the Rhine-Herne Canal, where a commercial-industrial [[harbour]] is to be found. The harbour has a yearly turnover of 2 000 000 [[Tonne|t]] and a water surface area of about 1.2&nbsp;km², one of Germany's biggest and most important canal harbours, and is furthermore connected to [[Deutsche Bahn]]'s [[railway]] network.

Local transport in Gelsenkirchen is afforded by [[tram]]s and [[bus]]es run by the ''[[BOGESTRA|Bochum-Gelsenkirchener Straßenbahn AG]]'' (''BOGESTRA''), as well as by ''[[Vestische Straßenbahnen GmbH]]'' in the city's north end (despite its name, it nowadays runs only buses). The [[Stadtbahn]] train U17, which connects Horst to [[Essen, Germany|Essen]], as well as tram line 107, which connects Gelsenkirchen Central Station to Essen, are operated by [[Essener Verkehrs-AG|EVAG]]. Tram line 302 connects the city to [[Bochum]]. All these services have an integrated fare structure within the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr|VRR]]. There are three tram lines, one light rail line, and about 50 bus routes in Gelsenkirchen.

=== Media ===
Gelsenkirchen is the headquarters of the ''Verband Lokaler Rundfunk in Nordrhein-Westfalen e.V. (VLR)'' (Network of Local Radio in North Rhine-Westphalia Registered Association ([[VLR]]). REL (''Radio Emscher-Lippe'') is also headquartered in Gelsenkirchen.

Among newspapers, the ''Buersche Zeitung'' was a daily till 2006. Then the paper was closed down, though economically there was no reason for it. The [[Dortmund]] paper ''[[Ruhr-Nachrichten]]'' did the local news section. Now, the ''Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung'' is the only local newspaper in Gelsenkirchen and has so to say a monopoly. The local radio station REL also reports the local news.

There is also a free weekly newspaper, the ''Stadtspiegel Gelsenkirchen'', along with monthly, or irregular, local publications called the ''Familienpost'' and the ''Beckhausener Kurier''.

=== Miscellaneous ===
On the occasion of the 2006 [[FIFA]] [[FIFA World Cup 2006|world football championship]], the transport infrastructure in Gelsenkirchen leading to the [[Veltins-Arena]] underwent modifications. Likewise, the main railway station is undergoing extensive reconstruction, with completion planned in time for the championship.

=== Education ===
Gelsenkirchen has 51 [[elementary school]]s (36 "community" schools, 12 Catholic schools, 3 Evangelical schools), 8 ''[[Hauptschule]]n'', 6 ''[[Realschule]]n'', 7 ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasien]]'', and 4 ''[[Education in Germany|Gesamtschule]]n'', among which the ''Gesamtschule Bismarck'', as the only comprehensive school run by the Westphalian branch of the Evangelical ([[Lutheran]]) Church, warrants special mention.

The ''[[Fachhochschule]] Gelsenkirchen'', founded in 1992, has campuses in [[Bocholt]] and Recklinghausen with the following course offerings: [[Economics]], [[Computer Science]], [[Physical Engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]], and Supply and Disposal Engineering.

Also found in Gelsenkirchen is one of the seven locations of the ''[[Fachhochschule]] für öffentliche Verwaltung NRW'' (''Fachhochschule'' for public administration North Rhine-Westphalia) offering as fields of study Municipal Administrative Service, Police Training, and Administrative Economics. There is also a [[folk high school]] as well as a city [[library]] with three branches in Horst, Buer and Erle with more than 700,000 books, films, and CDs.

==Sports==
Gelsenkirchen is home of the [[Association football|football]] [[Bundesliga (football)|club]] [[FC Schalke 04]]. Schalke's home ground, [[Veltins-Arena]], is generally regarded as one of the most innovative stadiums built in recent years. It was one of 12 German cities to host matches during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], and has already hosted the matches between Poland and Ecuador, Argentina and Serbia and Montenegro, Portugal and Mexico and USA and Czech Republic.

Gelsenkirchen has also hosted two important [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslav]] games. These games were Serbia's two largest [[FIFA world cup]] defeats.  They were a 6-0 loss to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and a 9-0 win over [[Congo DR national football team|Zaire]].
