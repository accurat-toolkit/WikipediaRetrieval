'''Hugh Capet'''<ref>Capet is a [[byname]] of uncertain meaning distinguishing him from his father [[Hugh the Great]]. [[Folk etymology]] connects it with cape, other suggested etymologies derive it from terms for chief, mocker or big head. See further [[:fr:Capet (nom)]]. His father's byname is presumed to have been retrospective, {{lang-la|Hugo Magnus}}, meaning Hugh the Elder, this Hugh being Hugh the Younger, Capet being a 12th century addition; James, p. 183.</ref> (c. 940 &ndash; 24 October 996) was the first [[King of France]] of the eponymous [[Capetian dynasty]] from his election to succeed the [[Carolingian]] [[Louis V of France|Louis V]] in 987 until his death.

==Descent and inheritance==
The son of [[Hugh the Great]], [[Duke of France]], and [[Hedwige of Saxony]], daughter of the [[King of Germany|German king]] [[Henry the Fowler]], Hugh was born about 940. His paternal family, the [[Robertians]], were powerful landowners in the [[Île-de-France (province)|Île-de-France]]. His grandfather had been [[Robert I of France|King Robert I]] and his grandmother [[Beatrice of Vermandois|Beatrice]] was a Carolingian, a daughter of [[Herbert I of Vermandois]]. This makes him the great-great-great-great-great grandson of [[Charlemagne]] on both his parents side through Louis the Pious and Pepin of Italy. [[Odo, Count of Paris|King Odo]] was his great uncle and [[Rudolph of France|King Rudolph]] Odo's son-in-law. Hugh was born into a well-connected and powerful family with many ties to the reigning nobility of Europe.<ref>For a fuller explanation of the descent and relationships of Hugh, see the genealogical tables in Riché, ''Les Carolingiens'', pp. 399 ff.</ref> But for all this, Hugh's father was never king. When Rudolph died in 936, Hugh the Great organized the return of [[Louis d'Outremer]], son of [[Charles the Simple]], from his exile at the court of [[Athelstan of England]]. Hugh's motives are unknown, but it is presumed that he acted to forestall Rudolph's brother and successor as Duke of Burgundy, [[Hugh the Black]] from taking the French throne, or to prevent it from falling into the grasping hands of [[Herbert II of Vermandois]] or [[William I of Normandy|William Longsword]], [[Duke of Normandy]]<ref>James, pp 183&ndash;184; Theis, pp 65&ndash;66.</ref>.

In 956, Hugh inherited his father's estates and became one of the most powerful nobles in the much-reduced [[West Francia|West Frankish kingdom]]. However, as he was not yet an adult, his uncle [[Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne|Bruno]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]], acted as [[regent]]. Young Hugh's neighbours made the most of the opportunity. [[Theobald I of Blois]], a former vassal of Hugh the Great, took the counties of [[Chartres]] and [[Châteaudun]]. Further south, on the border of the kingdom, [[Fulk II of Anjou]], another former client of Hugh the Great, carved out a principality at Hugh's expense and that of the [[Bretons]].<ref>Theis, pp. 69&ndash;70.</ref>

The realm in which Hugh grew up, and of which he would one day be king, bore no resemblance to modern France. Hugh's predecessors did not call themselves ''rois de France'' ("Kings of France"), and that title was not used until the time of his distant descendant [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] (died 1314). Kings ruled as ''rex Francorum'' ("King of the Franks") and the lands over which they ruled comprised only a very small part of the former [[Carolingian Empire]]. The [[East Francia|eastern Frankish lands]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], were ruled by the [[Ottonian]] dynasty, represented by Hugh's first cousin [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] and then by Otto's son, [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. The lands south of the [[river Loire]] had largely ceased to be part of the West Frankish kingdom in the years after Charles the Simple was deposed in 922. The [[Duchy of Normandy]] and the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] were largely independent, and [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] entirely so, although from 956 Burgundy was ruled by Hugh's brothers [[Odo, Duke of Burgundy|Odo]] and [[Otto-Henry, Duke of Burgundy|Henry]].<ref>James, pp. xxiii, 182&ndash;183; Gauvard, pp. 163&ndash;168; Riché, pp. 285 ff.</ref>

==Election and extent of power==
From 977 to 986, Hugh Capet allied himself with the German emperors Otto II and Otto III and with [[Archbishop of Reims|Archbishop]] [[Adalberon, Archbishop of Reims|Adalberon of Reims]] to dominate the Carolingian king, [[Lothair of France|Lothair]]. By 986, he was king in all but name. After Lothair and his son died in early 987, [[Adalberon (Archbishop of Reims)|Adalberon]] and [[Gerbert of Aurillac]] convened an assembly of nobles to elect Hugh Capet as their king. In front of an electoral assembly at [[Senlis]], Adalberon gave a stirring oration and pleaded to the nobles:
:''Crown the Duke. He is most illustrious by his exploits, his nobility, his forces. The throne is not acquired by hereditary right; no one should be raised to it unless distinguished not only for nobility of birth, but for the goodness of his soul.''{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

He was elected and crowned ''rex Francorum'' at [[Noyon]] in [[Picardy]] on 3 July 987, by the prelate of Reims, the first of the Capetian house. Immediately after his coronation, Hugh began to push for the coronation of his son [[Robert II of France|Robert]]. Hugh's own claimed reason was that he was planning an expedition against the [[Moorish]] armies harassing [[Borrel II of Barcelona]], an invasion which never occurred, and that the stability of the country necessitated two kings should he die while on expedition.<ref>Lewis, 908.</ref> [[Ralph Glaber]], however, attributes Hugh's request to his old age and inability to control the nobility.<ref>Lewis, 914.</ref> Modern scholarship has largely imputed to Hugh the motive of establishing a dynasty against the pretension of electoral power on the part of the aristocracy, but this is not the typical view of contemporaries and even some modern scholars have been less sceptical of Hugh's "plan" to campaign in Spain.<ref>Lewis, ''passim''.</ref> Robert was eventually crowned on 25 December that same year.

Hugh Capet possessed minor properties near Chartres and Angers. Between [[Paris]] and [[Orléans]] he possessed towns and estates amounting to approximately 400 square miles (1,000&nbsp;km²). His authority ended there, and if he dared travel outside his small area, he risked being captured and held for ransom, though, as God's anointed, his life was largely safe. Indeed, there was a plot in 993, masterminded by [[Adalberon, Bishop of Laon]] and [[Odo I of Blois]], to deliver Hugh Capet into the custody of Otto III. The plot failed, but the fact that no one was punished illustrates how tenuous his hold on power was. Beyond his power base, in the rest of France, there were still as many codes of law as there were fiefdoms. The "country" operated with 150 different forms of currency and at least a dozen languages.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} Uniting all this into one cohesive unit was a formidable task and a constant struggle between those who wore the crown of France and its feudal lords. As such, Hugh Capet's reign was marked by numerous power struggles with the vassals on the borders of the [[Seine]] and the Loire.

While Hugh Capet's military power was limited and he had to seek military aid from [[Richard I of Normandy]], his unanimous election as king gave him great moral authority and influence. [[Adémar de Chabannes]] records, probably apocryphally, that during an argument with the [[Count of Auvergne]], Hugh demanded of him: "Who made you count?" The count riposted: "Who made you king?"<ref>Bordenove, pp. 265&ndash;266</ref>.

==Dispute with the papacy==
Hugh made [[Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims|Arnulf]] Archbishop of Reims in 988, even though Arnulf was the nephew of his bitter rival, [[Charles of Lorraine]]. Charles thereupon succeeded in capturing Reims and took the archbishop prisoner. Hugh, however, considered Arnulf a turncoat and demanded his deposition by [[Pope John XV]]. The turn of events outran the messages, when Hugh captured both Charles and Arnulf and convoked a synod at Reims in June 991, which obediently deposed Arnulf and chose as his successor Gerbert of Aurillac. These proceedings were repudiated by Rome, although a second synod had ratified the decrees issued at Reims. John XV summoned the French bishops to hold an independent synod outside the King's realm, at [[Aachen]], to reconsider the case. When they refused, he called them to Rome, but they protested that the unsettled conditions en route and in Rome made that impossible. The Pope then sent a legate with instructions to call a council of French and German bishops at [[Mousson]], where only the German bishops appeared, the French being stopped on the way by Hugh and Robert.

Through the exertions of the legate, the deposition of Arnulf was finally pronounced illegal. After Hugh's death, Arnulf was released from his imprisonment and soon restored to all his dignities.

==Legacy==
Hugh Capet died on 24 October 996 in Paris and was interred in the [[Saint Denis Basilica]]. His son [[Robert of France|Robert]] continued to reign.

Most historians regard the beginnings of modern France with the coronation of Hugh Capet. This is because, as [[Count of Paris]], he made the city his power centre. The monarch began a long process of exerting control of the rest of the country from there.

He is regarded as the founder of the [[Capetian dynasty]]. The direct Capetians, or the [[House of Capet]], ruled France from 987 to 1328; thereafter, the Kingdom was ruled by collateral branches of the dynasty. All French kings through [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], and all royal [[pretenders]] since then, have belonged to the dynasty. {{As of|2009}}, members of the [[Capetian dynasty]] are still the heads of state of the kingdom of [[Spain]] (in the person of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Juan Carlos]]) and of the grand-duchy of [[Luxembourg]].
