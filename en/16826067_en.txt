"'''Give It 2 Me'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] from her eleventh studio album, ''[[Hard Candy (Madonna album)|Hard Candy]]''. It was released on June 4, 2008, by [[Warner Bros. Records]] as the second single from the album. The song was written by Madonna as an [[anthem]]ic, self-[[manifesto]] song which, although appears to be about dance and sex, but is a reference to Madonna's career spanning for three decades in the music industry. Musically, "Give It 2 Me" is an upbeat dance song with usage of West African inspired [[percussion]] and cowbells. Backing vocals are provided by [[Pharrell Williams]].

"Give It 2 Me" received positive reviews from contemporary critics. The song became Madonna's thirty-ninth number one single on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. The track reached a peak of fifty-seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for one week due to limited [[airplay (radio)|radio play]]. The song topped the music charts in several countries, including the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey, while it attained top ten positions of the rest of the European nations.

The music video featured Madonna recreating her look for the ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine photo shoot and was directed by photographer Tom Munro. Williams had a guest appearance in the video. It received positive response for her retro-inspired look. Madonna performed "Give It 2 Me" on both the promotional tour for ''Hard Candy'' and the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]], where she performed it as the final song of the concert. The song received a [[51st Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nomination in 2009 in the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] category,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1600678/20081204/coldplay.jhtml|title=Lil Wayne, Coldplay Lead Grammy Nominations|date=2008-12-04|accessdate=2009-04-27|last=Harris|first=Chris|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]}}</ref> but lost to [[electronica]] duo [[Daft Punk]] for their song "[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger#Structure|Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/grammy_Awards/51st_show/list.aspx|title=51st Grammy Awards, winners|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>

==Writing and inspiration==
"Give It 2 Me" was written by Madonna and [[Pharrell Williams]] as a self-empowerment song. In an interview with ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, when asked whether the song has the ability to be a party anthem in [[Ibiza]], Madonna said that she likes the idea of everybody dancing to "Give It 2 Me" by treating it as a party anthem.<ref name=Interview>{{cite web|last=Sischy|first=Ingrid|title=Madonna: the one and only, on her life unchained|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview magazine]]|publisher=[[CNET Networks]], Inc.|date= 2008-04-21|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_3_38/ai_n24945443/pg_6|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> When asked the inspiration behind writing the song, Madonna said,
<blockquote>
"It's [Give It 2 Me] very anthemic. I basically wrote it so I could have a great time doing it in a stadium. The words are very autobiographical. 'Got no boundaries, got no limits. [...] Don't stop me now. [...] If it's against the law, arrest me.' [...] Yes, that's me. It's the provocative me. The boring, predictable me."<ref name=Interview/>
</blockquote>

In an interview with [[MTV Australia]], Madonna explained that a prominent theme of the ''Hard Candy'' album was about incorporating the image of a boxer, an idea which has been continuously repeated within the song. According to Madonna, "[it] is basically you know I'm not you know, give me all you got, so it's quite a sort of tough stance". The title of the song was initially decided by Madonna to be used as the main title for the then unnamed album. This was changed following the release of a [[Give It to Me (Timbaland song)|similar named song]] by [[Timbaland]].<ref name="mtv2">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com.au/news/madonna-talks-filth-wisdom-and-confectionary-119df29f-3b4e-4529-ae5f-b7b00bc322aa/|title=Madonna Talks Filth, Wisdom And Confectionary|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=2008-03-13|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=2009-04-24}}</ref>

The song was performed during the promotional tour for the ''Hard Candy'' album and the 2008–2009 [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]]; both performances were similar. In the promotional tour, "Give It 2 Me" was performed as the fifth song of the setlist. Madonna wore a shiny black dress with black tails, [[Adidas]] track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots.<ref name="bostonpromo">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/blog/2008/04/madonna_opens_u.html|title=Madonna Opens Up "Candy" Shop|last=Rodman|first=Sarah|date=2008-04-30|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref> Every time the chorus broke out, Madonna and her back-up dancers jumped up and down while putting up their hands in the air. The performance was backed by [[laser]] lights in the background and two movable screens which portrayed Williams performing his lines.<ref name="nyhardpromo">{{cite news|url=http://themoment.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/gonna-make-you-sweat-madonna-at-the-roseland-ballroom/|title=Gonna Make You Sweat, Madonna at the Roseland Ballroom|last=Hawgood|first=Alex|date=2008-05-01|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>

In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, "Give It 2 Me" was performed as the closing song of the "Futuristic rave with Japanese influence" section.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwd.com/lifestyle-news/madonnas-costumes-for-her-sticky-and-sweet-tour-1703286|title=Madonna's Costumes for Her Sticky and Sweet Tour|last=Bernstein|first=Jacob|date=2008-08-05|work=WWD Lifestyle Magazine|publisher=Fairchild Fashion Group|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref> It was mixed with [[Peter Rauhofer]]'s remix of the [[Funky Green Dogs]] song "[[Get Fired Up|Fired Up!]]".<ref name="mash">{{cite web|url=http://dancemusic.about.com/od/artistshomepages/tp/StickySweetMashups.htm|title=Madonna's "Sticky and Sweet" Mashups|last=Slomowicz|first=DJ Ron|date=2008-11-11|work=[[About.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref> During the last segment of the show, Madonna wore a futuristic robotic dress designed by [[Heatherette]], with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair.<ref name="mtvref">{{cite news|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/06/06/madonnas-gonna-dress-herself-up-in-heatherette-for-sticky-sweet-tour/|title=Madonna's Gonna Dress Herself Up In Heatherette|last=Harris|first=Chris|date=2008-06-06|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref><ref name="nysticky"/> Madonna loses the breastplate she was wearing during the performance of "[[Hung Up]]" and starts the last performance of the tour with "Give It 2 Me". Parts of the lyrics flash on the screens in the style of a shooter video game, featuring 1980s games like ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''. Gradually, more and more dancers join Madonna, until they are all jumping on stage. Williams appeared on the screens and made special guest appearance for the performances at [[Madison Square Garden]], [[New York]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7666012.stm|title=Rapper Williams joins Madonna gig|date=2008-10-12|last=Hand|first=John|work=[[BBC]]|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref> Madonna extended the song, allowing the crowd to sing along with her while she shouted, "No one is ever going to stop me".<ref name="nysticky"/> At the end of the performance, the video backdrops show Madonna's sweaty, unsmiling, exhausted face as she disappears behind the reformed cubicle screens, which change to show the words 'Game Over' and "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]" playing in the background.<ref name="nysticky">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/arts/music/06mado.html?_r=1&scp=6&sq=sticky%20&%20sweet%20tour&st=cse|title=Aerobic, Not Erotic: The Concert as Workout|last=Pareles|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Pareles|date=2008-10-05|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/music/6117424.html|title=Madonna revs up Minute Maid crowd|last=Guerra|first=Joey|authorlink=Joey Guerra|date=2008-11-17|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=2009-04-29}}</ref>
