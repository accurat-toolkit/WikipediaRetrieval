==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}
[[Image:Connemara pony.jpg|thumb|left|A Commemara pony has a short, attractive head]]
The [[Connemara]] region in [[County Galway]] in western [[Ireland]], where the breed first became recognized as a distinct type, is a very harsh landscape, thus giving rise to a pony breed of hardy, strong individuals.  Some believe that the Connemara developed from Scandinavian ponies that the [[Vikings]] first brought to Ireland. Another source was likely the [[Irish Hobby]], a now-[[extinct]] breed established prior to the 13th century. Legend, however, says that galleons from the [[Spanish Armada]] ran aground in 1588, and the [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]]s on board were set loose. The Spanish horses bred with the native stock, refining the local ponies. 

For additional strength and stamina, [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] blood was added in the 1700s. They were also crossed with [[Hackney (horse)|Hackneys]] and [[Thoroughbred]]s. Too much [[crossbreeding]] began to dilute the pony bloodlines, so the Connemara Pony Breeders’ Society, founded in 1923, worked to preserve the breed type.  The [[breed registry|stud book]] was established in 1926.  Today, Connemaras are bred worldwide in [[Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], as well as on the European Continent,  the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

==Characteristics==
Connemaras are strong and sturdy with a short back and sloped, muscular croup. The hindquarters are powerful. The shoulder is sloped and long. Their legs have short, strong cannons and hard feet and a good stride length.  The breed has a fine head with small ears and usually a slightly dished profile set on a well-arched neck.  The Connemara is considered hardy and agile, with good jumping ability.  The Connemara has a lively but eager and trainable temperament, tends to be long-lived and is described as intelligent. They are hardy and are excellent mounts for children.<ref>[http://www.acps.org/connemaras/definition.htm American Connemara Pony Society definition]</ref> 

Connemaras in North America range from 13 to over 15 [[Hand (length)|hands]]. Recognized colors are [[gray (horse)|gray]], [[bay (horse)|bay]], brown (genetically, a darker variant of bay), and [[dun gene|dun]], with some [[roan (horse)|roans]], an occasional [[black (horse)|black]], [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], or [[palomino]]. [[Pinto horse|Pinto]]  patterns, called [[piebald]] and [[skewbald]] by the Connemara registry, are not acceptable for registration.<ref>[http://www.acps.org/connemaras/breedstandard.htm  American Connemara Pony Society breed standard.]</ref>
