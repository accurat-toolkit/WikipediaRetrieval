'''Ekibastuz''' ({{lang-kz|'''Екібастұз'''}}) is a town in [[Pavlodar Province]], northeastern [[Kazakhstan]]. It has a population of 127,200 (1999 census). It is served by [[Ekibastuz Airport]].

==History==
The history of Ekibastuz begins in the 19th century, when Kosym Pshembayev, a native [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] who was commissioned by Russian merchants to look for mineral resources in that region, alighted on a coal field  south-east of [[Pavlodar]]. He marked the place with two big lumps of salt. This identification gave the place its name: "Ekibastuz" means "two lumps of the salt" in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]. The commercial exploitation of the field started soon after. The field afterwards was sold to a British businessman named Urquart. The railway connection was constructed and the village "Ekibastuz" was established in 1899. 

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution in the Russian Empire]], as well as two World Wars, distracted the attention of the state from the exploitation of the field. The village was totally deserted. However, in 1948 the first team (only 50 people) started construction of the future town. The borders of the future open-cast coal fields were also marked at that time.

December 1954 was a significant period for Ekibastuz, because the first train loads of coal were loaded. From that time the industrial development of Ekibastuz started. In 1955 the millionth ton of the coal was produced.

The status of the "town" was given to Ekibastuz on [[July 12]], [[1957]] by a decree of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]]. At that time the population of Ekibastuz was approximately 25,000 people. Nowadays, the population of Ekibastuz is about 141,000 people.

==Industry==

Near Ekibastuz there are two [[coal]] fired [[power plant]]s: [[Ekibastuz GRES-1|GRES-1]], with installed capacity of 4,000&nbsp;MW, and [[GRES-2 Power Station|GRES-2]], with an installed capacity of 1,000&nbsp;MW. GRES-2 has the [[Chimney of GRES-2 Power Station|tallest chimney]] in the world (419.7 m).<ref>[http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?20374745 Diagram of 25 tallest flue gas stacks worldwide]</ref>

The construction of GRES-2 was part of a Program for Ekibastuz coalfield development, foreseeing to be built four Thermal Power Plants each one of 4,000&nbsp;MW (8 units x 500&nbsp;MWe). In years 1991-93 only Units No 1 & 2 were commissioned. The construction of Unit No 3 was started 1990 but later stopped.

From Ekibastuz to Kokshetau runs an [[overhead powerline]] designed for a transmission voltage of 1,150&nbsp;kV, the [[powerline Ekibastuz-Kokshetau|Ekibastuz-Kokshetau powerline]].

Today Ekibastuz is the biggest open-cast coal field and one of the most perspective open-cast coal regions in the world. It contains more than 13 billion tons of coal in the area of 62 square kilometers. In other words, there are 74 million tons of coal per square kilometer.

==Gulag==
It was the location of a major [[labor camp]] of the [[Gulag]] system maintained by the [[Soviet Union]] from the 1920s to the 1950s. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] served in this camp.
