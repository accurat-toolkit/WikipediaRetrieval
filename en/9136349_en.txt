'''Gniewkowo''' {{IPAr|pl|g|ń|e1|f|'|k|o|w|o}} ({{lang-de|Argenau}}) is a town in northern Poland with a population of 7,301 (2005).

== Location ==

Gniewkowo is located to the south of the [[Bydgoszcz]] forest on route 52, 15&nbsp;km northeast of [[Inowrocław]] and 23&nbsp;km southwest of [[Toruń]].

== History ==
[[Archaeological dig]]s have shown that the site was already populated by the [[Bronze Age]]. The first historical mention of the town dates from 1185. In 1268 the town was granted [[city rights]]. In 1314 [[Siemomysł of Inowrocław]]’s duchy was divided among his three sons; [[Casimir]] inherited the Gniewkowo region which became a small autonomous duchy. The [[Teutonic Knights]] laid siege to Gniewkowo in 1332 during their war with [[Poland]]. To avoid capture Casimir set fire to his chateau and abandoned the town. He would not regain control of the duchy until the [[Treaty of Kalisz (1343)|Treaty of Kalisz]] in 1343.

In 1364/1365, [[Władysław the White|Władysław (Ladislas) the White]] mortgaged Gniewkowo to [[Casimir III the Great]]. In 1408 the city hosted a meeting between [[Jogaila]] and the [[Teutonic Knights]] over the disputed [[Dobrzyń Land|Dobrzyń]] territory. From 1409 to 1411 Gniewkowo played an important role in the conflict between [[Poland]] and the [[Teutonic Order]].

Gniewkowo was ravaged by several fires during the [[XVI century]], limiting its development. During the [[XVII century]], war with [[Sweden]] and outbreaks of disease laid waste to the town.

Gniewkowo was annexed by [[Prussia]] in 1772 after the [[first partition of Poland]] (from 1807 to 1815 Gniewkowo was part of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]), during which time the economy began to develop. Starting in 1843, a road linked the city to [[Inowrocław]] and [[Toruń]]. [[Jews]] and [[Germans]] became more and more prominent, while the local Polish population suffered from an official policy of [[discrimination]]. A [[general strike]] broke out after [[German language|German]] became the required official language for religious classes. Electricity became available city-wide in 1908.

On [[January 17]], [[1920]], after a year of fighting, Gniewkowo rejoined a newly independent [[Poland]]. The town suffered greatly during the Polish economic crisis that followed [[World War I]]. On the eve of [[World War II]] the [[unemployment rate]] was 70%.

During [[World War II]] 4,000 civilians taken from Gniewkowo and the nearby towns of [[Inowrocław]], [[Bydgoszcz]] and [[Toruń]] were executed by the [[Nazis]] in the woods surrounding the town. Gniewkowo was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on [[January 21]], [[1945]].
