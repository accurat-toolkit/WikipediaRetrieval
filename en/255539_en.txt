'''Olof Skötkonung''' ([[Old Icelandic]]: ''Óláfr sænski'', [[Old Swedish]]: ''Olawær skotkonongær'') was the son of [[Eric the Victorious]] and [[Sigrid the Haughty]]. He was born around 980 and he succeeded his father in 995. 

==Etymology==
One of many explanations to his Swedish name ''Skötkonung'' is that it means "tributary king" and one scholar speculates about a tributary relationship to the Danish king [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], who was his stepfather.<ref>Sawyer, Peter (1997). ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings''. Oxford University Press, 1997. ISBN 0192854348, p.169.</ref> This explanation is however not supported by any historical source. 

==Life==
[[Image:Silvermynt slaget för Olof Skötkonung, Nordisk familjebok.png|left|250px|thumb|left|Coin minted for Olof Skötkonung in [[Sigtuna]]]]
Our knowledge of Olof is mostly based on [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s and [[Adam of Bremen]]'s accounts, which have been subject to criticism from source-critical scholars. But according to Adam of Bremen, Sweyn Forkbeard was forced to defend his Danish kingdom from attacks by Olof who claimed the Danish throne.  The conflict was resolved by Sweyn's marriage with Olaf's mother and the two kings were thereafter allies. Also Snorri Sturluson describes Sweyn and Olof as equal allies when they defeated the Norwegian king Olav Tryggvason in the [[battle of Svolder]] 1000, and thereafter divided Norway between themselves. Another possible explanation{{Fact|date=October 2007}} of the name "Skötkonung" is that it means "treasure king" and refer to the fact that he was the first Swedish king to stamp coins.

According to the [[Saga]]s, Olof's father [[Eric the Victorious]] ruled together with Eric's brother [[Olof (II) Björnsson|Olof Björnsson]]. When Olof Björnsson died, Olof was proclaimed co-ruler instead of his cousin [[Styrbjörn Starke]]. This happened before he was even born. At his father's death, he inherited the throne of Sweden and became its sole ruler.

===Viking expedition to Wendland===
In a Viking expedition to [[Wendland]], he had captured [[Edla]], the daughter of a Wendish chieftain, and she gave him the son [[Emund of Sweden|Emund]] (who was to become king of Sweden), and the daughter [[Astrid Olofsdotter|Astrid]] -later wife of [[Olaf II of Norway]]. He later married [[Estrid of the Obotrites]], and she bore him the son [[Anund Jacob]] and the daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]].

===Alliance with Sweyn Forkbeard===
Olof is said to have preferred royal [[sport]]s to war and therefore [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] retook [[Denmark]], which Olof's father Eric had conquered.<ref>Adam of Bremen (book 2, chapter 30)</ref> Olof also lost the right to tribute which his predecessors had preserved in what is now [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]].

In 1000, he allied with [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], who was married to Olof's mother, and with the Norwegian [[Jarl]]s [[Eiríkr Hákonarson|Eric]] and [[Sveinn Hákonarson|Sven]], against the Norwegian King [[Olaf Tryggvason]]. Olaf Tryggvason died in the [[Battle of Svolder]] and Olof gained a part of [[Trøndelag]] as well as modern [[Bohuslän]].<ref>Snorri Sturluson, "Heimskringla" (Olav Tryggvason's saga, chapter 113)</ref>

===Norwegian-Swedish War===
When the Norwegian kingdom was reestablished by [[Olaf II of Norway]], a new war erupted between Norway and Sweden. Many men in both [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] tried to reconcile the kings. In 1018, Olof's cousin, the [[earl]] of [[Västergötland]], [[Ragnvald Ulfsson]] and the Norwegian king's emissaries [[Björn Stallare]] and [[Hjalti Skeggiason]] had arrived at the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] of [[Uppsala]] in an attempt to sway the Swedish king to accept peace and as a warrant marry his daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]] to the king of Norway. The Swedish king was greatly angered and threatened to banish Ragnvald from his kingdom, but Ragnvald was supported by his foster-father [[Thorgny Lawspeaker]].

Thorgny delivered a powerful speech in which he reminded the king of the great Viking expeditions in the East that predecessors such as [[Erik Eymundsson]] and [[Björn (III) Eriksson|Björn]] had undertaken, without having the hubris not to listen to their men's advice. Thorgny, himself, had taken part in many successful pillaging expeditions with Olof's father [[Eric the Victorious]] and even Eric had listened to his men. The present king wanted nothing but Norway, which no Swedish king before him had desired. This displeased the Swedish people, who were eager to follow the king on new ventures in the East to win back the kingdoms that paid tribute to his ancestors, but it was the wish of the people that the king make peace with the king of Norway and give him his daughter Ingegerd as queen. 

Thorgny finished his speech by saying: if you do not desire to do so, we shall assault you and kill you and not brook anymore of your warmongering and obstinacy. Our ancestors have done so, who at [[Mula thing]] threw five kings in a well, kings who were too arrogant as you are against us.

However, Olof married his daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter|Ingegerd-Irene]] to [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] instead. An impending war was settled when Olof agreed to share his power with his son [[Anund Jacob]]. Olof was also forced to accept a settlement with [[Olaf II of Norway]] at [[Kungahälla]], who already had been married (unbeknownst to Olof) with Olof's daughter, Astrid, through the [[Geatish]] jarl [[Ragnvald Ulfsson]].

===Christian King===
Olof was baptised, probably by the missionary [[Sigfrid of Sweden|Sigfrid]], ''c.''1008, and he was the first Swedish king to remain Christian until his death. However, according to [[Adam of Bremen]], the fact that the vast majority of the Swedes were still pagan forced him to limit Christian activities to the already Christian border province of [[Västergötland]].

When he stamped coins in [[Sigtuna]] in the province of [[Uppland]] Olof used the word ''rex'' for ''king''. ''OLUF REX'' as in the coin displayed above or ''OLAF REX''. The use of Latin seems to suggest that he was already baptised at this time but on the other hand the coins were imitating English pennies in type and style. Sigtuna is written ''SITUN'', ''ZINT'' (in the coin above), ''ZTNETEI'', or ''SIDEI''. The two last has been deciphered as ''Si(gtuna) Dei'' meaning ''God's Sigtuna''.<ref>Thunmark-Nylén, Lena + (1981). ''Vikingatidens ABC'', Statens historiska museum, 1981.

==Óláfsdrápa sœnska==
The [[Iceland]]ic [[skald]] [[Óttarr svarti]] spent some time at Olof's court and composed the poem ''[[Óláfsdrápa sœnska]]'' describing Olof's war expeditions in the east. Other skalds who served Olof were [[Gunnlaugr ormstunga]], [[Hrafn Önundarson]] and [[Gizurr svarti]].

==Death==
[[File:OlovSkötkonungHusaby.jpg|thumb|right|The alleged ''Olaf Grave'' at Husaby Church]]
His death is said to have taken place in the winter of 1021–1022. According to a legend he was martyred at Stockholm after refusing to sacrifice to pagan gods. He's venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church.

Since the 1740s, it has been claimed that he was buried in [[Husaby]] in the Christian part of his kingdom, but it should be noted that such identifications are speculation, and by no means uncontroversial. The remains in the alleged grave are also too young to be his.
