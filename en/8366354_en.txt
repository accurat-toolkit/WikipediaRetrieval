'''Oskars Kalpaks''' ([[January 6]], [[1882]]&ndash;[[March 6]], [[1919]]) was the commander of [[1st Latvian Independent Battalion]], also known as "Kalpaks Battalion". 

Kalpaks was born to a farming family.  Having decided to become a soldier he completed [[Irkutsk]] military school and then commenced service with the 183rd Pultusk Infantry Regiment.  He displayed talent as a commander and heroism in battle during the [[First World War]] and was awarded the most significant Russian military decorations and made Regiment Commander in 1917.

Afer the proclamation of Latvia's independence on [[18 November]] [[1918]], Kalpaks enlisted with the Ministry of Defence.  He organised the defence of [[Vidzeme]] against [[Bolshevik]] attacks.  On [[31 December]] Kalpaks became Commander-in-Chief of all the armed units at the disposal of the Provisional Government of Latvia.  

Under his leadership, Latvia's first armed formations became battle capable.  On [[28 February]] [[1919]], Kalpaks was awarded the rank of Colonel.  From January to March 1919 the 1st Latvian Battalion repelled the Bolshevik raids into Kurzeme and this was the start of Latvia's struggle for liberation.  On [[6 March]] [[1919]] near Airītes, Kalpaks was killed in a skirmish with [[Freikorps in the Baltic|German Freikorps]] troops.  

After his death, Kalpaks was posthumously awarded Latvia's highest military award, '[[Order of Lāčplēsis]] I III Class'. {{Clarifyme|date=February 2009}}

Although never officially assigned to this rank or position<ref>Pursuant to order of Minister of Defense of Latvian Provisional government, on December 31, 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Kalpaks was assigned commander of all Latvian forces subordinated to Headquarters of [[Baltische Landeswehr|Baltic Landeswehr]].
