[[Image:CIRCLE 1.svg|thumb|left|A disk is the region bounded by a circle. An '''open disk''' is the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of the disk excluding the bounding circle, while a '''closed disk''' (see [[closed|closed set]]) is the open disk together with the bounding circle.]]
In [[geometry]], a '''disk''' (also [[Spelling of disc|spelled]] '''disc''') is the region in a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] bounded by a [[circle]]. 

A disk is said to be ''closed'' or ''open'' according to whether or not it contains the circle that constitutes its boundary. In [[Cartesian coordinates]], the open disk of center <math>(a, b)</math> and radius ''R'' is given by the formula
:<math>D={(x, y)in {mathbb R^2}: (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2 < R^2}</math>
while the closed disk of the same center and radius is given by 
:<math>overline{ D }={(x, y)in {mathbb R^2}: (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2 le R^2}.</math>

The [[area (geometry)|area]] of a closed or open disk of radius ''R'' is π''R''<sup>2</sup> (see [[pi|π]]). 

The ''[[Ball (mathematics)|ball]]'' is the disk generalised to [[metric spaces]]. However, sometimes "disk" is used to mean "ball".

In theoretical physics a disk is a rigid body which is capable of participating in collisions in a [[two-dimensional gas]].  Usually the disk is considered rigid so that collisions are deemed [[elastic collision|elastic]].

The Euclidean disk is [[Circular symmetry|circular symmetrical]].

== Topological notions ==

The open disk and the closed disk are not homeomorphic, since the latter is [[compact space|compact]] and the former is not. However from the viewpoint of [[algebraic topology]] they share many properties: both of them are [[contractible space|contractible]] and so are [[homotopy equivalent]] to a single point. This implies that their [[fundamental group]]s are trivial, and all [[homology group]]s are trivial except the 0th one, which is isomorphic to '''Z'''. The [[Euler characteristic]] of a point (and therefore also that of a closed or open disk) is 1.

Every [[continuous map]] from the closed disk to itself has at least one [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] (we don't require the map to be [[bijective]] or even [[surjective]]); this is the case ''n''=2 of the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]]. The statement is false for the open disk: consider for example 

:<math>f(x,y)=left(frac{x+sqrt{1-y^2}}{2},y
ight)</math>

which maps every point of the open unit disk to another point of the open unit disk slightly to the right of the given one.
