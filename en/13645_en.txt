The horse has [[evolution of the horse|evolved]] over the past 45 to 55&nbsp;million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large, [[odd-toed ungulate|single-toed]] animal of today. Humans began to [[Domestication|domesticate]] horses around 4000&nbsp;BCE, and their [[domestication of the horse|domestication]] is believed to have been widespread by 3000&nbsp;BCE; by 2000&nbsp;BCE the use of domesticated horses had spread throughout the [[Eurasia]]n continent. Although most horses today are domesticated, there are still endangered populations of the [[Przewalski's Horse]], the only remaining true [[wild horse]], as well as more common [[feral horse]]s which live in the wild but are descended from domesticated ancestors.

There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from [[anatomy]] to life stages, size, [[equine coat color|color]]s, [[horse markings|markings]], [[List of horse breeds|breeds]], [[animal locomotion|locomotion]], and behavior. Their anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed [[Equilibrioception|sense of balance]] and a strong [[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]] instinct. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. Female horses, called [[mare]]s, carry their young for approximately 11&nbsp;months, and a young horse, called a [[foal]], can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under [[saddle]] or in [[Horse harness|harness]] between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30&nbsp;years. 

Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as [[draft horse]]s and some [[Pony|ponies]], suitable for slow, heavy work; and "[[warmblood]]s", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are over 300&nbsp;breeds of horses in the world today, developed for many different uses. 

Horses and humans interact in many ways, not only in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, but also in working activities including [[Mounted police|police work]], [[working animal|agriculture]], entertainment, assisted learning and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare. A wide variety of [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[driving (horse)|driving]] techniques have been developed, using many different styles of [[Horse tack|equipment]] and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as [[veterinarian]]s and [[farrier]]s.

==Biology==
{{Main|Equine anatomy}}
[[Image:Horse parts.jpg|right|thumb|Parts of a horse|upright=1.5|alt=Diagram of a horse with some parts labeled.]]

[[Horse anatomy]] is described by a large number of specific terms, as illustrated by the chart to the right. Specific terms also describe various ages, colors and [[list of horse breeds|breeds]].

===Age===
Depending on breed, management and environment, the domestic horse today has a life expectancy of 25 to 30&nbsp;years.<ref name=Ensminger46/> It is uncommon, but a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_age.htm|title=The Age of a Horse|publisher=Government of Ontario|work=Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs|author=Wright, B.|date=March 29, 1999|accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref> The oldest verifiable record was "[[Old Billy]]", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.<ref name=Ensminger46/><ref name="horsefacts">{{cite web |url= http://www.fbresearch.org/HorseFacts/Facts/|title= The Mane Facts About Horse Health|accessdate=2007-01-22 |work= Horsefacts.org |publisher= Foundation for Biomedical Research}}</ref> In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007, aged 56.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9708|title= World's Oldest Living Pony Dies at 56|accessdate=2007-05-31 |author= Ryder, Erin |work= TheHorse.com |publisher= The Horse}}</ref>

Regardless of a horse's actual birth date, for most competition purposes an animal is considered a year older on January&nbsp;1 of each year in the northern hemisphere<ref name=Ensminger46/><ref>British Horse Society ''The Manual of Horsemanship of the British Horse Society'' p. 255</ref> and August&nbsp;1 in the southern hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.studbook.org.au/DisplayPDF.aspx?ty=RULES |format=PDF |title= Rules of the Australian Stud Book |accessdate=2008-07-09 |year= 2007  |publisher=Australian Jockey Club |page=7}}</ref> The exception is in [[endurance riding]], where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's calendar age.<ref name=Endurance>{{cite web |url= http://www.aerc.org/horseage.asp|title= Age Matters (Your Horse's Age, That Is!)|accessdate=2008-04-05|work= |publisher= American Endurance Riding Conference}}</ref> A very rough estimate of a horse's age can be made from looking at its [[Horse teeth|teeth]].<ref name=Ensminger46/>

The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:
* [[Foal]]: a horse of either sex less than one year old. A nursing foal is sometimes called a ''suckling'' and a foal that has been weaned is called a ''weanling.''<ref name=Ensminger418>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 418</ref>  Most domesticated foals are weaned at 5 to 7&nbsp;months of age, although foals can be weaned at 4 months with no adverse effects.<ref>Giffen, et al., ''Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook'', p. 431</ref>
* [[Yearling (horse)|Yearling]]: a horse of either sex that is between one and two years old.<ref>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 430</ref>
* [[Colt (horse)|Colt]]: a male horse under the age of four.<ref>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 415</ref>  A common terminology error is to call any young horse a "colt", when the term actually only refers to young male horses. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
* [[Filly]]: a female horse under the age of four.<ref name=Ensminger418/>
* [[Mare]]: a female horse four years old and older.<ref>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 422</ref>
* [[Stallion (horse)|Stallion]]: a non-castrated male horse four years old and older.<ref>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 427</ref> Some people, particularly in the UK, refer to a stallion as a "horse".<ref name=Ensminger420>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 420</ref> 
* [[Gelding]]: a [[castration|castrated]] male horse of any age,<ref name=Ensminger418/> though for convenience sake, many people also refer to a young gelding under the age of four as a "colt".

In [[horse racing]], the definitions of colt, filly, mare, and stallion may differ from those given above. In the UK, [[Thoroughbred]] horse racing defines a colt as a male less than five years old, and a filly as a female less than five years old.<ref>Hammond ''The Language of Horse Racing'' pp. 49,79</ref> In the United States, both [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred racing]] and [[harness racing]] define colts and fillies as four years old and younger.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.equibase.com/newfan/glossary-full.cfm|title= Glossary of Horse Racing Terms|accessdate=2008-04-03 |work= Equibase.com|publisher= Equibase Company, LLC}}</ref>

===Size===
{{Main| Hand (length)}}
The English-speaking world measures the height of horses in [[Hand (length)|hands]], abbreviated "h" or "hh", for "hands high". A horse is measured at the highest point of its [[withers]], where the neck meets the [[back (horse)|back]], chosen as the highest stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down.  One hand is {{convert|4|in|cm}}. Intermediate heights are defined by hands and inches, rounding to the lower measurement in hands, followed by a decimal point and the number of additional inches between 1 and 3. Thus a horse described as "15.2 h", is 15&nbsp;hands, 2&nbsp;inches ({{convert|62|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=/}}) in height.<ref name=Ensminger51>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 51</ref>  

[[Image:Horse-and-pony.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Size varies greatly among horse breeds, as with this full-sized horse and a miniature horse.|alt=A large brown horse is chasing a small horse in a pasture.]]

The height and weight of horses varies by [[list of horse breeds|breed]], but can also be influenced by [[equine nutrition|nutrition]]. Light riding horses such as [[Arabian horse|Arabians]], [[Morgan horse|Morgans]], or [[American Quarter Horse|Quarter Horse]]s usually range in height from {{hands|14|to|16}} and can weigh from {{convert|380|to|550|kg}}.<ref>Bongianni ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World'' entry 1,68,69</ref> Larger riding horses such as [[Thoroughbred]]s, [[American Saddlebred]]s or [[Warmblood]]s usually start at about {{hands|15.2}} and often are as tall as {{hands|17}}, weighing from {{convert|500|to|600|kg}}.<ref>Bongianni ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World'' entry 12,30,31,32,75</ref> Heavy or [[draft horse]]s, such as the [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]], [[Belgian (horse)|Belgian]], or [[Shire horse|Shire]], are usually at least {{hands|16|tp|18}} high and can weigh from about {{convert|700|to|1000|kg}}.<ref>Bongianni ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World'' entry 86, 96, 97</ref>

The largest horse in recorded history was probably a [[Shire horse]] named [[Sampson (horse)|Mammoth]], who was born in 1848. He stood 21.2½ hands high ({{convert|86.5|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=/}}), and his peak weight was estimated at {{convert|1500|kg}}.<ref name=Whitaker60>Whitaker ''The Horse'' p. 60</ref> The current record holder for the world's smallest horse is [[Thumbelina (horse)|Thumbelina]], a fully mature miniature horse affected by [[dwarfism]]. She is {{convert|17|in|cm}} tall and weighs {{convert|27|kg}}.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=409317&in_page_id=1770|title=Meet Thumbelina, the World's Smallest Horse |accessdate=2006-10-08 |author= Martin, Arthur |work= Daily Mail}}</ref>

====Ponies====
{{main|Pony}}
The general rule for cutoff in height between what is considered a horse and a [[pony]] at maturity is {{hands|14.2}}. An animal 14.2&nbsp;h or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 14.2&nbsp;h a pony.<ref name=EnsmingerHT11>Ensminger ''Horses and Tack'' pp. 11–12</ref> However, there are a number of exceptions to the general rule.   In Australia, ponies measure under {{hands|14}}.<ref>Howlett ''Ponies in Australia''</ref>{{page number}} The [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]], which uses [[metric]] measurements, defines the cutoff between horses and ponies at {{convert|148|cm|in|2}} (just over 14.2 h) without shoes and {{convert|149|cm|in|2}} (just over 14.2-1/2 h) with shoes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fei.org/Disciplines/Youth/News/Info_Youth/Pages/20070130-1450.aspx | title=Pony Measurement 2007: Explanation of Article 3103.1 |publisher=Fédération Equestre Internationale | date =January 30, 2007| accessdate= 2009-10-07}}</ref>  Some breeds which typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2&nbsp;h considered all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height.<ref>For example, the [[Missouri Fox Trotter]] or the [[Arabian horse]]. See McBane ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds'' pp. 192, 218</ref> Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2&nbsp;h, but are still considered to be ponies.<ref>For example, the [[Welsh Pony]]. ''See'' McBane ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds'' pp. 52–63</ref> 

The distinction between a horse and pony is not simply a difference in height, but takes account of other aspects of ''[[phenotype]]'' or appearance, such as [[Equine conformation|conformation]] and temperament. Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails and overall coat. They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They often have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of equine intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers.<ref name=EnsmingerHT11/>  In fact, small size, by itself, is sometimes not a factor at all. While the [[Shetland pony]] stands on average {{hands|10}},<ref name=HorseTack12>Ensminger ''Horses and Tack'' p. 12</ref> the [[Falabella (horse)|Falabella]] and other [[miniature horse]]s, which can be no taller than {{convert|30|in|cm}}, the size of a medium-sized dog, are classified by their respective [[breed registries|registries]] as very small horses rather than as ponies.<ref>McBane ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds'' p. 200</ref>

===Colors and markings===
{{Main|Equine coat color|Equine coat color genetics|Horse markings}}
[[File:Horsescd1l-095.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|[[Bay (horse)|Bay]] (left) and [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] (sometimes called "sorrel") are two of the most common coat colors, seen in almost all breeds.|alt=Two horses in a field. The one on the left is a dark brown with black mane and tail. The one on the right is a light red all over.]]

Horses exhibit a diverse array of [[Equine coat color|coat colors]] and distinctive [[horse markings|markings]], described with a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex.<ref>Vogel, ''The Complete Horse Care Manual'', p. 14</ref> Flashy or unusual colors are sometimes very popular, as are horses with particularly attractive markings. Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by their markings.<ref>Mills, et al., ''A Basic Guide to Horse Care and Management'', pp. 72–73</ref>

The [[Equine coat color genetics|genetics]] that create many horse coat colors have been identified, although research continues on specific genes and mutations that result in specific color traits. Essentially, all horse colors begin with a genetic base of "red" ([[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]]) or "black", with the addition of [[allele]]s for spotting, graying, suppression or [[dilution gene|dilution]] of color, or other effects acting upon the base colors to create the dozens of possible coat colors found in horses.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolorhorse.php|title= Horse Coat Color Tests|accessdate=2008-05-01 |work= Veterinary Genetics Laboratory |publisher= University of California}}</ref>

Horses which are light in color are often misnamed as being "white" horses. A horse that looks pure white is, in most cases, actually a middle-aged or older [[gray (horse)|gray]]. Grays have black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of small amounts of pink skin under white [[horse markings|markings]]). The only horses properly called [[white (horse)|white]] are those with pink skin under a white hair coat, a fairly rare occurrence.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolor.php|title= Introduction to Coat Color Genetics|accessdate=2008-05-01|work= Veterinary Genetics Laboratory |publisher= University of California}}</ref> There are no truly [[Albinism|albino]] horses, with pink skin and red eyes, as albinism is a lethal condition in horses.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2004.00481.x?journalCode=jbg |title= Genetic mapping of dominant white (W), a homozygous lethal condition in the horse (Equus caballus) (2004)|accessdate=2006-09-06 |author= Mau, C., Poncet, P.

===Reproduction and development===
{{Main|Horse breeding}}

[[Gestation]] lasts for approximately 335–340&nbsp;days<ref name=HorseTack129>Ensminger ''Horses and Tack'' p. 129</ref> and usually results in one [[foal]]. Twins are very rare.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www2.okstate.edu/pio/twinfoals.html|accessdate=2008-09-23|title=Rare Twin Foals Born at Vet Hospital: Twin Birth Occurrences Number One in Ten Thousand| author=Johnson, Tom|work= Communications Services, Oklahoma State University|publisher= Oklahoma State University}}</ref> Colts are carried on average about 4 days longer than fillies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hura |first=V |coauthors=et al. |year=1997 |month=October |title=The effect of some factors on gestation length in nonius breed mares in Slovakia (Egyes tényezõk hatása a nóniusz fajta vemhességének idõtartamára)|journal=Proceedings of Roundtable Conference on Animal Biotechnology |volume=XIII |url=http://www.oai.hu/kerekasztal/XIII./hura.htm |accessdate= 2008-04-22 }}</ref> Horses are a [[precocial]] species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth.<ref>Miller, ''Revolution,'' pp. 102–103</ref>
[[Image:Horses.london.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Mares and foals|alt=A dark colored horse standing in a field with a smaller baby horse nursing from it.]]
Horses, particularly colts, may sometimes be physically capable of reproduction at about 18&nbsp;months. In practice, individuals are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females.<ref name=HorseTack129/> Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; the precise time of completion of development also depends on the horse's size, breed, gender, and the quality of care provided by its owner. Also, if the horse is larger, its bones are larger; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to actually form [[Osseous tissue|bone tissue]], but the [[epiphyseal plate]]s are also larger and take longer to convert from [[cartilage]] to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, but are crucial to development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equineortho.colostate.edu/questions/dod.htm |title=Developmental Orthopaedic Disease: Problems of Limbs in young Horses|accessdate=2008-04-20|author= McIlwraith, C.W.|publisher=Colorado State University|work=Orthopaedic Research Center}}</ref>

Depending on maturity, breed, and the tasks expected, young horses are usually put under saddle and [[horse training|trained]] to be ridden between the ages of two and four.<ref name=Train163>Thomas ''Storey's Guide to Training Horses'' p. 163</ref> Although [[Thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|race horse]]s are put on the track at as young as two years old in some countries,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jockeyclub.com/factbook.asp?section=11|title= 2-Year-Old Racing (US and Canada)|accessdate=2008-04-28 |work= Online Fact Book|publisher= Jockey Club}}</ref> horses specifically bred for sports such as [[dressage]] are generally not entered into top-level competition until they are a minimum of four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed, nor is their advanced training complete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dressage-connection.com/dressage_article_younghorse.html|title= The Correct Age and Way to Break a Young Horse|accessdate=2009-09-11 |author= Crebbin, Tess|publisher= Dressage Connection}}</ref> For [[endurance riding]] competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60&nbsp;calendar months (5 years) old.<ref name=Endurance/>

===Anatomy===

====Skeletal system====
{{Main|Skeletal system of the horse}}
[[Image:Horseanatomy.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The skeletal system of a modern horse|alt=Diagram of a horse skeleton with major parts labeled.]]

Horses have a skeleton that averages 205 bones.<ref name=Evans90>Evans ''The Horse'' p. 90</ref>  A significant difference between the horse skeleton, compared to that of a human, is the lack of a [[Clavicle|collarbone]]—the horse's [[Equine forelimb anatomy|front limb]] system is attached to the [[Vertebral column|spinal column]] by a powerful set of muscles, tendons and ligaments that attach the [[Scapula|shoulder blade]] to the torso. The horse's legs and hooves are also unique structures. Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. For example, the [[equine forelimb anatomy|body part]] that is called a horse's "knee" is actually made up of the [[Carpus|carpal]] bones that correspond to the human [[wrist]]. Similarly, the [[Equine anatomy|hock]], contains the bones equivalent to those in the human [[ankle]] and [[heel]]. The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the [[Equine anatomy|fetlock]] (incorrectly called the "ankle") is actually the proximal [[sesamoid bone]]s between the [[Equine anatomy|cannon]] bones (a single equivalent to the human [[Metacarpus|metacarpal]] or [[Metatarsus|metatarsal]] bones) and the [[proximal phalanges]], located where one finds the "knuckles" of a human. A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, [[tendon]]s, [[ligament]]s, [[cartilage]], and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the [[horse hoof|hoof]].<ref name=Ensminger21>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 21–25</ref>

====Hooves====
{{Main|Horse hoof}}
{{See also|Horseshoe|Farrier}}

The critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, "no foot, no horse".<ref name=Ensminger367>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 367</ref> The [[horse hoof]] begins with the [[distal phalanges]], the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by [[cartilage]] and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the [[Horse hoof#Internal structures|laminae]]. The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of essentially the same material as a human [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernail]].<ref>Giffin ''Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook'' p. 304</ref> The end result is that a horse, weighing on average {{convert|500|kg}},<ref>Giffin ''Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook'' p. 457</ref> travels on the same bones as a human on tiptoe.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle_pf.cfm?id=118|title= Yes, The Shin Bone Is Connected to the Ankle Bone|accessdate=2008-04-05 |author= Fuess, Ph.D., Theresa A.|work= Pet Column|publisher= University of Illinois}}</ref> For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have [[horseshoe]]s placed on their feet by a professional [[farrier]]. The hoof continually grows, and needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks.<ref>Giffin ''Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook'' pp. 310–312</ref>

====Teeth====
{{Main|Horse teeth}}

Horses are adapted to grazing. In an adult horse, there are 12&nbsp;[[incisor]]s, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation, at the front of the mouth. There are 24&nbsp;teeth adapted for chewing, the [[premolar]]s and [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s, at the back of the mouth. Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] that are called "tushes". Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] teeth in front of the molars, known as  "wolf" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the [[bit (horse)|bit]]. There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the bars (gums) of the horse's mouth when the horse is [[bridle]]d.<ref>Kreling ''Horses' Teeth and Their Problems'' pp. 12–13</ref>  

The incisors show a distinct wear and growth pattern as the horse ages, as well as change in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. The [[horse teeth|teeth]] continue to erupt throughout life as they are worn down by grazing, so a very rough estimate of a horse's age can be made by an examination of its teeth, although diet and veterinary care can affect the rate of tooth wear.<ref name=Ensminger46>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 46–50</ref>
<br clear=both>

====Digestion====
{{Main|Equine anatomy#Digestive system|Equine nutrition}}

Horses are [[Herbivory|herbivore]]s with a digestive system adapted to a [[forage]] diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. A {{convert|450|kg|adj=on}} horse will eat {{convert|7|to|11|kg}} of food per day and, under normal use, drink {{convert|38|L}} to {{convert|45|L}} of [[water]]. Horses are not [[ruminant]]s, so they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can also digest [[cellulose]] from grasses due to the presence of a "hind gut" called the [[cecum]], or "water gut", which food goes through before reaching the [[large intestine]]. Unlike humans, horses cannot vomit, so digestion problems can quickly cause [[horse colic|colic]], a leading cause of death.<ref>Giffin ''Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook'' p. 175</ref>

====Senses====
{{See also|Equine vision}}

The horse's senses are generally superior to those of a human. As [[predation|prey animals]], they must be aware of their surroundings at all times.<ref name=Ensminger309>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 309–310</ref> They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and because their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads, horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular (seen with both eyes) and the remaining 285° monocular (seen with only one eye).<ref>Sellnow, ''Happy Trails'', p. 46</ref> Horses have excellent day and [[night vision]], but studies indicate that they have two-color, or [[Dichromacy|dichromatic vision]]; their [[color vision]] is somewhat like [[Color blindness#Red-green color blindness|red-green color blindness]] in humans. This means that certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear more green.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9670|title= In Living Color |format=registration required|accessdate=2007-07-27 |author= McDonnell, Sue |work= The Horse |date= June 1, 2007|publisher= The Horse, Inc.}}</ref>

Their hearing is good,<ref name=Ensminger309/> and the [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the potential for 360° hearing without having to move the head.<ref>Myers ''Horse Safe'' p.7</ref> Their [[Olfaction|sense of smell]], while much better than that of humans, is not their strongest asset; they rely to a greater extent on vision.<ref name=Ensminger309/>

Horses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] abilities (the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/horse-health/1998/October/17/True-horse-sense.aspx|title= True Horse Sense|accessdate=2008-07-08 |author= Thomas, Heather Smith |work= Thoroughbred Times |publisher= Thoroughbred Times Company}}</ref> A horse's [[Somatosensory system|sense of touch]] is well developed.

===Movement===
{{Main|Horse gait|Trot (horse gait)|Canter|Ambling}}
[[File:Muybridge race horse animated.gif|thumb|left|The gallop|upright=1.4|alt=Film showing a horse running.]]
All horses move naturally with four basic [[horse gait|gaits]]: the four-beat [[Horse gait#Walk|walk]], which averages {{convert|6.4|km/h}}; the two-beat [[Trot (horse gait)|trot or jog]], which averages {{convert|13|to|19|km/h}} (faster for [[harness racing]] horses); and the [[leaping gait]]s known as the [[Canter|canter or lope]] (a three-beat gait that is {{convert|19|to|24|km/h}}, and the [[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]].<ref name=HorseGaits32>Harris ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' p. 32</ref> The gallop averages {{convert|40|to|48|km/h}}.<ref name=Harris47>Harris, ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' p. 47–49</ref>  The world record for a horse galloping over a short, [[Sprint (race)|sprint]] distance is {{convert|88|km/h}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing.aqha.com/racing/dyn_content.aspx?FQD=http://www.aqha.com/aqharacing.com/gettingstarted/firsttimersguide/thehorse.html|title=About the Horse|work=First Timers Guide|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=American Quarter Horse Association}}</ref>  Besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat [[Horse gait#Pace|pace]], instead of the trot.<ref name=HorseGaits50>Harris ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' p. 50</ref>  In addition, there are several four-beat "[[ambling]]" gaits that are approximately the speed of a trot or pace, though smoother to ride.

===Behavior===
{{Main|Horse behavior|Stable vices}}
Horses are prey animals with a well-developed [[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]] instinct. Their first response to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they are known to stand their ground and defend themselves or their offspring in cases where flight is not possible, or when their young are threatened. They also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain large draft horses. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors.<ref name=Natural226>McBane ''A Natural Approach to Horse Management'' pp. 226–228</ref> Horses are herd animals, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant animal (usually a mare). They are also social creatures who are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual [[Social grooming|grooming]], and [[body language]]. Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated. Through proper training, it is possible to teach any horse to accept a human as a type of companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses.<ref name=Ensminger305>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 305–309</ref> When confined with insufficient companionship, exercise or stimulation, individuals may develop [[stable vices]], an assortment of bad habits, mostly [[psychology|psychological]] in origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, "weaving" (rocking back and forth) and other problems.<ref name=Prince214>Prince ''Basic Horsemanship'' pp. 214–223</ref>

====Intelligence and learning====
In the past, horses were considered unintelligent, with no [[concept|abstract thinking]] ability, unable to generalize, and driven primarily by a [[herd mentality]]. However, recent studies show that they perform a number of [[Cognition|cognitive]] tasks on a daily basis, and frequently engage in mental challenges that include [[foraging|food procurement]] and [[Social structure|social system]] identification. They have also been shown to have good [[Spatial visualization ability|spatial discrimination]] abilities.<ref name=Hanggi>{{cite web|url=http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/features/horseintelligence-119.shtml|title=Understanding horse intelligence|author=Hanggi, Evelyn B.|date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2008-09-16|work=Horsetalk 2007|publisher=Horsetalk}}</ref>

Studies have assessed equine intelligence in the realms of [[problem solving]], learning speed, and knowledge retention. Results show that horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to solve advanced cognitive challenges that involve [[categorization]] and [[concept learning]]. They have been shown to learn from [[habituation]], [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]], [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]], and [[operant conditioning]].   They respond to and learn from both [[Reinforcement|positive]] and negative reinforcement.<ref name=Hanggi/>

Domesticated horses tend to face greater mental challenges than wild horses, due to living in artificial environments that stifle [[instinct]]ual behavior while learning tasks that are not natural.<ref name=Hanggi/> Horses are creatures of [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] that respond and adapt well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. Some trainers believe that "intelligent" horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that fits best with an individual animal's natural inclinations. Others who handle horses regularly note that personality also may play a role separate from intelligence in determining how a given animal responds to various experiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.bloodhorse.com/blogs/nicanor/archive/2008/06/17/equine-iq-what-big-brown-couldn-t-tell-you-and-mr-ed-kept-to-himself.aspx|title=What Big Brown Couldn't Tell You and Mr. Ed Kept to Himself (part 1)|author=Coarse, Jim|date=2008-06-17|accessdate=2008-09-16|work=The BloodHorse|publisher=Blood-Horse Publications}}</ref>

====Temperament====
{{Main|Draft horse|Warmblood|Oriental horse}}
[[File:Subject (horse) 20080420P1.jpg|thumb|right|Thoroughbred race horses are a "hot blooded" breed.|alt=A saddled dark horse being led by a person in a suit]]
Horses are [[mammal]]s, and as such are "[[warm-blooded]]" creatures, as opposed to [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] [[reptile]]s. However, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]]. For example, the "hot-bloods", such as many [[horse racing|race horses]], exhibit more sensitivity and energy,<ref name=Belknap255>Belknap ''Horsewords'' p. 255</ref> while the "cold-bloods", such as most [[draft horse|draft breeds]], are quieter and calmer.<ref name=Belknap112>Belknap ''Horsewords'' p. 112</ref>><!--Terminology also used in hardcopy April or May 2009 Horse and Rider mag...search on web site should pop it up online in another month or so, they delay uploads--> Sometimes "hot-bloods" are classified as "light horses" or "riding horses",<ref name=Ensminger71>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 71–73</ref> with the "cold-bloods" classified as "draft horses" or "work horses".<ref name=Ensminger84>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 84</ref>

[[File:Karel van Gaasbeek.JPG|thumb|left|The "cold blooded" draft breeds are powerful and heavily-muscled|alt=A large and muscled dark brown horse with thick mane and thick hair on its lower legs.]]

"Hot blooded" breeds include "[[oriental horse]]s" such as the [[Akhal-Teke]], [[Barb (horse)|Barb]], [[Arabian horse]] and now-extinct [[Turkoman horse]], as well as the [[Thoroughbred]], a breed developed in England from the older oriental breeds.<ref name=Belknap255/> Hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly. They are bred for agility and speed.<ref name=Catalog18/> They tend to be physically refined—thin-skinned, slim, and long-legged.<ref>DeFilippis ''The Everything Horse Care Book'' p. 4</ref>  The original oriental breeds were brought to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa when European breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light [[cavalry]] horses.<ref name=Whitaker43>Whitaker ''The Horse'' p. 43</ref><ref name=Whitaker194>Whitaker ''The Horse'' pp. 194-197</ref>

Muscular, heavy [[draft horse]]s are known as "cold bloods", as they are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people.<ref name=Belknap112/> They are sometimes nicknamed "gentle giants".<ref name=Catalog15>Price ''Whole Horse Catalog'' p. 15</ref> Well-known draft breeds include the [[Belgian (horse)|Belgian]] and the [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]].<ref name=Catalog15/> Some, like the [[Percheron horse|Percheron]] are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates.<ref name=Guide87>Bongianni ''Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World'' entry 87</ref> Others, such as the [[Shire horse|Shire]], are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils.<ref name=Ens124>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' pp. 124-125</ref>  The cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.<ref>Bennett, ''Conquerors,'' p. 7</ref> 

[[File:WCLV07f.JPG|thumb|right|A modern "Warmblood" horse is large, but agile and athletic.|alt=A dark brown horse being ridden across an arena, with one front leg reaching far forward.]]

"[[Warmblood]]" breeds, such as the [[Trakehner]] or [[Hanoverian (horse)|Hanoverian]], developed when European carriage and [[horses in warfare|war horses]] were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and more phlegmatic temperament than a lighter breed.<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 122–123</ref> Certain [[pony]] breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders.<ref>Examples are the [[Australian Riding Pony]] and the [[Connemara pony|Connemara]], see Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 178–179, 208–209</ref> Warmbloods are considered a "light horse" or "riding horse".<ref name=Ensminger71/>

Today, the term "Warmblood" refers to a specific subset of [[sport horse]] breeds that are used for competition in [[dressage]] and [[show jumping]].<ref name=Lyons231>Price et al. ''Lyons Press Horseman's Dictionary'' p. 231</ref> Strictly speaking, the term "[[Warmblood|warm blood]]" refers to any [[crossbreeding|cross]] between cold-blooded and hot-blooded breeds.<ref name=Belknap523>Belknap ''Horsewords'' p. 523</ref> Examples included breeds such as the [[Irish Draught]] or the [[Cleveland Bay]]. Less often, the term was even used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than Thoroughbreds or Arabians, such as the [[Morgan horse]].<ref name=Catalog18>Price, et al. ''Whole Horse Catalog'' p. 18</ref>

====Sleep patterns====

[[Image:Biandintz eta zaldiak - modified2.jpg|thumb|left|When horses lie down to sleep, others in the herd remain standing, awake or in a light doze, keeping watch.|alt=Two horses in a pasture, one is standing beside the other that is laying down.]]
Horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a "stay apparatus" in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqzzz629/|title= How Horses Sleep |accessdate=2007-03-23 |author= Pascoe, Elaine |work= Equisearch.com |publisher= EquiSearch}}</ref> Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its [[instinct]]s are to keep a constant eye out for danger.<ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"/>

Unlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours,<ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2">{{cite web |url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqpowernap1771/|title= How Horses Sleep, Pt. 2 - Power Naps|accessdate=2007-03-23 |author= Pascoe, Elaine|work= Equisearch.com |publisher= EquiSearch}}</ref> mostly in short intervals of about 15&nbsp;minutes each.<ref name=Ensminger310>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 310.</ref> 

Horses must lie down to reach [[Rapid eye movement (sleep)|REM sleep]]. They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements.<ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"/> However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/sleepdisorder_121506/|title= Equine Sleep Disorder Videos|accessdate=2007-03-23 |author=EQUUS Magazine Editors |work= Equisearch.com |publisher= EquiSearch}}</ref> This condition differs from [[narcolepsy]], although horses may also suffer from that disorder.<ref name="Smith">Smith ''Large Animal Internal Medicine'' pp. 1086–1087</ref>

{{Main|Evolution of the horse}}

The horse as it is known today adapted by [[evolution]] to survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, surviving in an [[ecosystem]] where other large grazing animals, especially [[ruminant]]s, could not.<ref name="Budiansky">Budiansky ''The Nature of Horses'' p. 31</ref> Horses and other equids are [[odd-toed ungulate]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Odd-toed ungulate|Perissodactyla]], a group of mammals that was dominant during the [[Tertiary]] period. In the past, this order contained 14&nbsp;[[Family (biology)|families]] and many species, but only three families&mdash;[[Equidae]] (the horse and related species), the [[tapir]] and the [[rhinoceros]]&mdash;containing 18&nbsp;known species have survived to the present day.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Perissodactyla.html|title= Order Perissodactyla|accessdate=2008-07-09 |author= Myers, Phil|work= Animal Diversity Web |publisher= University of Michigan}}</ref> The earliest known member of the Equidae family was the ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which lived between 45 and 55&nbsp;million years ago, during the [[Eocene]] period and had 4&nbsp;toes on each front foot, and 3&nbsp;toes on each back foot.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fhc/hyraco1.htm|title= Hyracotherium|accessdate=2008-07-09 |work= Fossil Horses in Cyberspace |publisher= Florida Museum of Natural History}}</ref>  The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the ''[[Mesohippus]]'', which lived 32 to 37&nbsp;million years ago,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fhc/mesoh1.htm|title= Mesohippus|accessdate=2008-07-09|work= Fossil Horses in Cyberspace |publisher= Florida Museum of Natural History}}</ref> and by about 5&nbsp;million years ago, the modern Equus had developed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fhc/equus1.htm|title= Equus|accessdate=2008-07-09work= Fossil Horses in Cyberspace |publisher= Florida Museum of Natural History}}</ref>  The extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished.

Over millions of years, equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, and grazing of tougher plains grasses.   Thus the proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the [[steppe]]s of Eurasia and the [[Great Plains]] of North America.  

About 15,000 years ago ''Equus ferus'' was a widespread, [[holarctic]] species.

===Wild species surviving into modern times===
{{Main|Wild horse}}
[[File:Przewalskipferd cologne.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|A Przewalski's Horse|alt=A cream colored horse with upright black mane walking across an enclosure.]]
A truly wild horse is a species or subspecies which has no ancestors that were ever domesticated. Therefore, most "wild" horses today are actually [[feral horse]]s, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals.<ref name=Olsen46>Olsen, "Horse Hunters of the Ice Age", ''Horses Through Time'', p. 46</ref>  

Only two types of truly wild horses survived into recorded history. One, the [[Tarpan]] (''Equus ferus ferus'') survived into the historical era, but became [[Extinction|extinct]] in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo.<ref name=Dohner300>Dohner "Equines: Natural History" ''Encyclopedia of Historic Livestock and Poultry Breeds'' p. 300</ref> Its pure genetic line was lost, but three attempts have been made to re-create the Tarpan. None of the breeding programs were completely successful, although all three resulted in horses with many similarities to the Tarpan. The [[Heck horse]] was created by the [[Germans|German]] [[zoologist]] brothers [[Heinz Heck]] and [[Lutz Heck]] at the [[Tierpark Hellabrunn]] ([[Munich]] Zoo) in Germany in an attempt to [[breeding back|breed back]] the Tarpan.<ref name=OSU>{{cite web|url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/tarpan/|title=Tarpan|publisher=Oklahoma State University|work=Breeds of Livestock|accessdate=January 13, 2009}}</ref> In 1936, Polish university professor Tadeusz Vetulani began a program using [[Konik]] horses,<ref name=Dohner300/> and in the 1960s Harry Hegardt started a program in the United States using feral mustangs and local working ranch horses that has resulted in the Hegardt or Stroebel's Horse.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=894&dat=20020621&id=YiALAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yFIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6481,3069519|journal=The Daily Courier|date=June 21, 2002|accessdate=2009-10-21|title=Ponies from the past?: Oregon couple revives prehistoric Tarpan horses}}</ref>

There is only one true wild horse species alive today, the [[Przewalski's Horse]] (''Equus ferus przewalskii''). It is a rare Asian animal, also known as the Mongolian Wild Horse; [[Mongolia]]n people know it as the ''taki'', and the [[Kyrgyz]] people call it a ''kirtag''. Small wild breeding populations of this animal, named after the Russian explorer [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], exist in Mongolia.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.treemail.nl/takh/|title= Home|accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher= The Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse}}</ref><ref name=Dohner298>Dohner "Equines: Natural History" ''Encyclopedia of Historic Livestock and Poultry Breeds'' pp. 298-299</ref> There are also small populations maintained at zoos throughout the world. The species was considered extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, but a small breeding population was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.zsl.org/info/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html|title= An extraordinary return from the brink of extinction for worlds last wild horse|date=2005-12-19|accessdate=2008-04-29|work= ZSL Press Releases|publisher= Zoological Society of London}}</ref>

In 1995, a population of horses was discovered in the [[Riwoqê County|Riwoche Valley]] of [[Tibet]], unknown to the rest of the world. It was speculated that these small [[Riwoche horse]]s were a relic population of wild horses,<ref name=Dohner298/> but testing did not reveal genetic differences with domesticated horses,<ref name=Tibet>Peissel, ''Tibet'', p. 36</ref> which is in line with news reports indicating that they are used as pack and riding animals by the [[Khamba|local villagers]].<ref name=CNN>{{cite web |title= Tibetan discovery is 'horse of a different color' |publisher=CNN |year=1995 |month=November |day=17 |accessdate=2009-09-09|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/WORLD/9511/tibet_pony/index.html |author=Humi, Peter}}</ref> These horses are hypothesized to be a possible missing link between wild and domesticated horses, in part due to their resemblance to the images known as "horse no 2" seen in prehistoric [[cave painting]]s alongside of images of the Przewalski's horse.<ref name=Tibet/>

===Other modern equids===
{{Main|Equus (genus)}}
Besides the horse, there are seven other species of [[genus]] ''equus'' in the equidae [[family]].

Horses can [[crossbreed]] with other members of the ''equus'' genus. The most common [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] is the [[mule]], a cross between a "jack" (male donkey) and a [[mare]]. A related hybrid, a [[hinny]], is a cross between a stallion and a [[jenny (donkey)|jenny]] (female donkey).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishmulesociety.org.uk/|title= Mule Information|accessdate=2008-07-10 |work= BMS Website|publisher= British Mule Society}}</ref> Other hybrids include the [[zorse]], a cross between a zebra and a horse that is bred in Africa and used for trekking on [[Mount Kenya]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-464723/Meet-Eclyse--amazing-zebra-crossing.html|title= Meet Eclyse - the amazing zebra crossing|accessdate=2008-07-10 |work= Mail Online|publisher= Associated Newspapers Ltd}}</ref>  With rare exceptions, most hybrids are [[infertility|sterile]] and cannot reproduce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12260255 |title=Befuddling Birth: The Case of the Mule's Foal|accessdate=2008-08-16|author= |work=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref>

==Domestication==
{{Main|Domestication of the horse}}
Competing theories exist as to the time and place of initial domestication. The earliest evidence for the [[domestication of the horse]] comes from sites in [[Ukraine]] and [[Kazakhstan]], dating to approximately 3,500–4,000&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Matossian ''Shaping World History'' p. 43 See also: {{cite web |title=Podcast |url=http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/archives/08-09/qq-2009-03-07.html|work=Quirks and Quarks Podcast with Bob Macdonald  |publisher= CBC Radio |date=2009-03-07|accessdate=2009-09-14}}</ref> It is thought that the horse was completely domesticated by 3000&nbsp;BCE, and by 2000&nbsp;BCE there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent.<ref>Evans ''Horse Breeding and Management'' p. 56</ref>

===The "Four Foundations" theory===
[[Image:Prezewalsky 26-9-2004-2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Przewalski's Horse]], the last surviving wild horse species|upright=1.4|alt=Three cream colored horses grazing in a pasture.]]

Modern [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA evidence]] suggests that domesticated horses evolved from multiple wild populations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Briggs, Helen|date=July 16, 2002 |title=Origins of domestic horse revealed|journal=BBC News Online |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2129182.stm |accessdate= 2008-07-07}}</ref> 
Classification based on body types and conformation, absent the availability of [[DNA]] for research, suggest that there were roughly four basic wild prototypes, thought to have developed with adaptations to their environment prior to domestication. There are competing theories, some argue that the four prototypes were separate species or subspecies, while others suggest that the prototypes were physically different manifestations of the same species.<ref name="Bennett7">Bennett, ''Conquerors'', p.7</ref> These animals probably were able to crossbreed with each other, thus were not completely separate species. Other theories hold that there was only one wild species and all different body types were entirely a result of [[selective breeding]] after domestication.<ref>Edwards, ''The Arabian,'' pp 1, 3</ref> 

Whether wild or developed during early domestication, under the four foundations theory, all types and breeds of horses are thought to have developed from the following base prototypes:
* The "Warmblood subspecies" or "[[Forest Horse]]" (once proposed as ''Equus ferus silvaticus'', also called the Diluvial Horse), which evolved into a later variety sometimes called ''Equus ferus germanicus''. This prototype may have contributed to the development of the [[warmblood]] horses of northern [[Europe]], as well as older "heavy horses" such as the [[Ardennais]].
* The "Draft" subspecies, a small, sturdy, heavyset animal with a heavy hair coat, arising in northern Europe, adapted to cold, damp climates, somewhat resembling today's [[Fjord horse]] and even the [[Shetland pony]].
* The "[[oriental horse|Oriental]]" subspecies, (once proposed as ''Equus agilis'') a taller, slim, refined and agile animal arising in western [[Asia]], adapted to hot, dry climates, thought to be the progenitor of the modern [[Arabian horse]] and [[Akhal-Teke]].
* The "Tarpan" subspecies: dun-colored, sturdy animal, the size of a large pony, adapted to the cold, dry climates of northern Asia, the predecessor to the [[Tarpan]] and [[Przewalski's Horse]] as well as the domesticated [[Mongolian horse]].<ref name="Bennett7"/>

===Feral populations===
{{Main|Feral horse}}

[[Feral]] horses are born and live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals.<ref name=Olsen46/> Many populations of [[feral horse]]s exist throughout the world.<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', p. 291</ref><ref>Anthony, "Bridling Horse Power: The Domestication of the Horse", ''Horses Through Time'', pp. 66–67</ref> Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegiemnh.org/anthro/olsen_horse.html | author=Olsen, Sandra L.|title= Horses in Prehistory|work=Anthropology Research | publisher=Carnegie Museum of Natural History|accessdate=2008-08-16}}</ref> as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15037&src=RA|title=Mares' Social Bonds Might Enhance Reproductive Success|date=October 7, 2009|accessdate=2009-10-21|journal=The Horse|format=Registration required|author=Lesté-Lasserre, Christa}}</ref>

===Breeds===
{{Main|List of horse breeds|Horse breeding|Selective breeding}}
Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as [[equine conformation|conformation]], color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits are usually the result of a combination of natural crosses and [[artificial selection]] methods aimed at producing horses for specific tasks. Certain breeds are known for certain talents. For example, [[Standardbred horse|Standardbred]]s are known for their speed in [[harness racing]]. Some breeds have been developed through centuries of crossings with other breeds, while others, such as [[Tennessee Walking Horse]]s and [[Morgan horse|Morgans]], developed from a [[foundation bloodstock|single sire]] from which all current breed members descend. There are more than 300&nbsp;horse breeds in the world today.<ref>Hedge ''Horse Conformation'' pp. 307–308</ref>

====Origin of breeds====
{{See also|Domestication of the horse}}

Modern horse breeds developed in response to a need for "form to function", the necessity to develop certain physical characteristics in order to perform a certain type of work.<ref name=Sponenberg155>Sponenberg, "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds", ''Horses Through Time'', p. 155</ref> Thus, powerful but refined breeds such as the [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] or the [[Lusitano]] developed in the [[Iberian peninsula]] as riding horses that also had a great aptitude for [[dressage]],<ref name=Sponenberg155/> while heavy draft horses such as the [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]] and the [[Shire horse|Shire]] developed out of a need to perform demanding [[farm]] work and pull heavy wagons.<ref>Sponenberg, "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds", ''Horses Through Time'', pp. 156–57</ref> Ponies of all breeds originally developed mainly from the need for a [[working animal]] that could fulfill specific local draft and transportation needs while surviving in harsh environments. However, by the 20th century, many pony breeds had [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and other blood added to make a more refined pony suitable for riding.<ref>Sponenberg, "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds", ''Horses Through Time'', pp. 155, 170–173</ref> Other horse breeds developed specifically for light agricultural work, heavy and light carriage and road work, various equestrian disciplines, or simply as pets.<ref name=Spon162>Sponenberg, "The Proliferation of Horse Breeds", ''Horses Through Time'', p. 162</ref>

====Purebreds and registries====
{{Main|Breed registry|Purebred}}
Horses have been [[Selective breeding|selectively bred]] since their [[domestication of the horse|domestication]]. Today, there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world. However, the concept of [[purebred]] bloodstock and a controlled, written [[breed registry]] only became of significant importance in modern times. Today, the standards for defining and registration of different breeds vary. Sometimes purebred horses are called [[Thoroughbred]]s, which is incorrect; "Thoroughbred" is a specific breed of horse, while a "purebred" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] recognized by a breed registry.<ref name=Ensminger424>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 424</ref> 

An early example of people who practiced selective [[horse breeding]] were the [[Bedouin]], who had a reputation for careful breeding practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their [[Arabian horse]]s and placing great value upon pure bloodlines.<ref>Edwards ''The Arabian'', pp. 22–23</ref> Though these pedigrees were originally transmitted via an [[oral tradition]], written pedigrees of Arabian horses can be found that date to the [[14th century]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.waho.org/History.html|title= Is Purity the Issue? |accessdate=2008-04-29 |work= WAHO Publication Number 21 January 1998|publisher= World Arabian Horse Organization}}</ref> In the same period of the early [[Renaissance]], the [[Carthusian]] monks of southern Spain bred horses and kept meticulous pedigrees of the best bloodstock; the lineage survives to this day in the [[Andalusian horse]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|title= Andalusian |accessdate=2008-04-29|work= Breeds of Livestock|publisher= Oklahoma State University}}</ref> One of the earliest formal registries was [[General Stud Book]] for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the Arabian stallions imported to England from the Middle East that became the [[foundation bloodstock|foundation]] stallions for the breed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/racehorses/history.asp|title= History of Thoroughbreds |accessdate=2008-04-03|work= Britishhorseracing.com|publisher= British Horseracing Authority}}</ref>

Some breed registries have a [[closed stud book]], where registration is based on pedigree, and no outside animals can gain admittance. For example, a registered [[Thoroughbred]] or Arabian must have two registered parents of the same breed.<ref name=JockeyClub>{{cite web |url= http://www.jockeyclub.com/registry.asp?section=3#one|title= American Stud Book Principal Rules and Requirements|accessdate=2007-07-05|publisher= Jockey Club}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.arabianhorses.org/registration/reg_rules.asp |title= 2008 Rules & Regulations|accessdate=2008-04-03 |work= 2008 Rulebook|publisher= Arabian Horse Association}}</ref> Other breeds have a partially closed stud book but still allow certain infusions from other breeds. For example, the modern [[Appaloosa]] must have at least one Appaloosa parent, but may also have a [[American Quarter Horse|Quarter Horse]], Thoroughbred, or Arabian parent so long as the offspring exhibits appropriate color characteristics.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.appaloosa.com/pdfs/rulebook07.pdf|format=PDF|title= Appaloosa Horse Club Handbook 2007|accessdate=2007-07-05 |work= 2007 Rulebook|publisher= The Appaloosa Horse Club}}</ref> The Quarter Horse normally requires both parents to be registered Quarter Horses, but allows [[American Quarter Horse#"Appendix" and "Foundation" horses|"Appendix"]] registration of horses with one Thoroughbred parent, and the horse may earn its way to full registration by completing certain performance requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aqha.com/association/registration/pdf/registrationrules_07.pdf|format=PDF|title= AQHA Registration Rules and Regulations|accessdate=2007-07-05 |work= 2007 Rulebook|publisher= American Quarter Horse Association}}</ref>

Others, such as most of the [[warmblood]] breeds used in [[sport horse]] disciplines, have [[open stud book]]s to varying degrees. While pedigree is considered, outside bloodlines are admitted to the registry if the horses meet the set standard for the registry. These registries usually require a [[studbook selection]] process involving judging of an individual animal's quality, performance, and [[Equine conformation|conformation]] before registration is finalized.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.americanwarmblood.org/|title= What Is A Warmblood Anyway?|accessdate=2008-05-01 |author= Bernhold, Suzette|work= Warmblood Whisper|publisher= American Warmblood Society}}</ref> A few "registries", particularly some [[color breed]] registries, are very open and will allow membership of all horses that meet limited criteria, such as coat color and species, regardless of pedigree or conformation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.palominohorseassoc.com/regandmembershipins.htm|title= Registration and Membership Instructions|accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher= Palomino Horse Association}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.pintohorseregistry.com/RulesProcedures.html |title=Registration Procedure|publisher=National Pinto Horse Registry|accessdate=2008-09-28}}</ref>

Breed registries also differ as to their acceptance or rejection of breeding technology. For example, all [[Jockey Club]] Thoroughbred registries require that a registered Thoroughbred be a product of a natural mating, so called "live cover". A [[foal]] born of two Thoroughbred parents, but by means of [[artificial insemination]] or [[embryo transfer]], cannot be registered in the Thoroughbred studbook.<ref name=JockeyClub/> On the other hand, since the advent of [[DNA]] testing to verify parentage, most breed registries now allow artificial insemination (AI), embryo transfer (ET), or both. The high value of stallions has helped with the acceptance of these techniques because they allow a stallion to breed more mares with each "collection", and greatly reduce the risk of injury during mating.<ref>{{cite journal |author= McAfee, Melonyce |date=2007-01-30|title= Did They Save Barbaro's Semen? |journal= Slate  |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2158610/ |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref> [[Cloning]] of horses is highly controversial, and at the present time most mainstream breed registries will not accept cloned horses, though several cloned horses and mules have been produced.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Mott, Maryann |date=2006-04-04|title= Champion Horses Cloned by Texas Breeder |journal= National Geographic News  |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/04/0404_060404_horse_clone.html |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref>

Around the world, horses play a role within human cultures. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) reports that in 2003, China had the largest number of horses in the world with over 8&nbsp;million, followed by Mexico (6,260,000), Brazil (5,900,500), the United States (5,300,000), and Argentina (3,655,000).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fao.org/ag/aga/glipha/index.jsp|title= Global Livestock Production and Health Atlas|accessdate=2007-08-22 |publisher= Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |work= GLiPHA}}</ref>  The [[American Horse Council]] estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cthorsecouncil.org/AHC2005JuneEconStudy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Most Comprehensive Horse Study Ever Reveals A Nearly $40 Billion Impact On The U.S. Economy|accessdate=2005-06-20|work= American Horse Council Press Release|publisher= American Horse Council}}</ref> In a 2004 "poll" conducted by [[Animal Planet]], more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world's 4th favorite animal.<ref name=IOL>{{cite web |url= http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?newslett=1&em=28164a99a20041206ah&click_id=29&art_id=qw1102325040750B216&set_id=1|title=Tiger tops dog as world's favourite animal |accessdate=2008-04-03 |work= Independent Online|publisher= Independent}}</ref>

===Sport===
<!-- There is a whole article about Equestrianism for all details about every possible sport. This article should only give the bare summary. So, please do not add elaborate sections of your own favorite horse sport here. -->
{{Main|Equestrianism|Horse racing|Horse training|Horse tack}}
Historically, equestrians honed their skills through competitions, games and races. Equestrian sports have the dual purpose of providing entertainment for crowds and creating and preserving the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as [[dressage]], [[eventing]] and  [[show jumping]], had origins in [[horses in warfare|military training]], which were focused on control and balance in both the horse and the rider. Other sports, such as [[rodeo]], developed from practical skills such as those needed on working [[ranch]]es. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques.<ref name="Olsen">Olsen, "In the Winner's Circle", ''Horses Through Time'', pp. 105, 111–113, 121</ref>  [[Horse racing]], whether the horse was ridden or driven, evolved out of impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. The evolving competitions, requiring ever more demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have rapidly disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.<ref>Olsen, "In the Winner's Circle", ''Horses Through Time'', p. 105</ref>

[[Image:WC07b.JPG|thumb|left|A horse performing a [[dressage]] test|alt=A white horse being ridden by a rider in a black coat and top hat|upright=1.3]]

Horses are trained to be ridden or driven in many different sporting events and competitions. Examples include [[show jumping]], [[dressage]], three-day [[eventing]], [[combined driving|competitive driving]], [[endurance riding]], [[Gymkhana (equestrian)|gymkhana]], [[rodeo]]s and [[fox hunting]].<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 346–356, 366–371</ref>  [[Horse show]]s, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world as venues in which horses are competed, exhibited and sold. They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as [[halter (horse show)|"In-hand"]] classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to exhibit their conformation. The method of judging classes varies depending on the discipline, but winning awards usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 376–377</ref>
Sports such as [[polo]] do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse assists this process and requires specialized training to do so, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other achievement.<ref name=Edwards360>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', p. 360</ref>  Examples of these sports of partnership between human and animal also include [[jousting]] (reenacting the skills used by medieval [[knight]]s), in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other,<ref>Collins, ''Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports'', pp. 173–174</ref> and [[buzkashi]], a team game played throughout [[Central Asia]], the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.<ref name=Edwards360/>

[[Horse racing]] is an equestrian sport and also a huge international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: "flat" racing; [[Steeplechase|steeplechasing]], i.e. racing over jumps; and [[harness racing]], where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a [[sulky]].<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 332–337</ref>  A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the [[Gambling#Gambling on horse races|gambling]] associated with it.<ref>Campbell, ''National Gambling Impact Study Commission Final Report'', p. 111</ref>

Communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity;<ref name="Olsen"/> to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a [[saddle]] on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a [[bridle]] or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control.<ref>Edwards, ''Horses'', pp. 32–34</ref> Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle,<ref>Self, ''Riding Simplified'', p. 55</ref> and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Montag, Molly |date=2008-07-17|title= Bridleless, Bareback Reining Queen Stacy Westfall |journal= Cowgirl Living |url= http://www.rodeoattitude.com/spur/livestock/equine/stacy-westfall-clm-1521.shtml |accessdate=2008-08-16}}</ref><ref>Thorson "Rugged Lark" ''Legends 7'' p. 218</ref> Many horses are also [[Driving (horse)|driven]], which requires a [[horse harness|harness]], bridle and some type of [[horse-drawn vehicle|vehicle]].<ref>Mettler, ''Horse Sense'', pp. 47–54</ref>

===Work===
[[File:Policja konna Poznań.jpg|thumb|A mounted police officer in Poland|upright=1.2|alt=A mounted man in a blue uniform on a dark brown horse]]

There are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed that can fully replace them. For example, [[mounted police]] horses are still effective for certain types of patrol duties and crowd control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/uspp/fhorsepage.htm |title= Horse Mounted Unit|accessdate=2008-04-07|work= United States Park Police|publisher= National Park Service}}</ref> Cattle [[ranch]]es still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain.<ref>Edwards, ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse'', pp. 226–227</ref> [[Search and rescue]] organizations in some countries depend upon [[mounted search and rescue|mounted]] teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sbcsheriff.org/msru_job.html|title= Volunteer Mounted Search and Rescue Unit|accessdate=2008-07-08|work= Employment|publisher= San Benito County Sheriff's Office}}</ref>  Horses can also be used in other areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil. Examples include areas such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in [[wilderness area]]s. They are also quieter than motorized vehicles. [[Law enforcement officer]]s such as [[park ranger]]s or [[game warden]]s may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/publications/success_story_updates/2003-05.pdf |format=PDF|title=Success Stories |accessdate=2008-04-20 |author=US Forest Service |year=2003 |month=May |chapter=Mules Key in Accomplishing Trail Work |publisher=US Department of Agriculture |pages=4 }}</ref>

Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less use of fossil fuels and increased environmental conservation can be seen over time with the use of [[working animal|draft animals]] such as horses.<ref>Gifford, "Working Draught Horses as Singles and Pairs", ''The Working Horse Manual'', p. 85</ref><ref>Miller, ''Work Horse Handbook'', p. 13</ref> In forestry, logging can be done with horses and can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.<ref>Gifford, "Working Horses in Forestry", ''The Working Horse Manual'', p. 145</ref>  Although machinery has replaced horses in many parts of the world, an estimated 100&nbsp;million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27&nbsp;million working in Africa alone.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=7001|title=At Work in Morocco|format=Registration required|author=Brown, Kimberly S.|journal=The Horse|date=June 1, 2006|accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref>

Horses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not.  "Equine-assisted" or "equine-facilitated" [[psychotherapy]] is a form of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with psychological problems, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, mental illness and those who are going through major life changes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.narha.org/SecEFMHA/FactSheet.asp|title=Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy (EFP) Fact Sheet|accessdate=2008-07-08 |publisher=  Equine Facilitated Mental Health Association}}</ref> Equine Assisted Learning (EAL) (also known as equine guided education or equine assisted professional development) is a field of experiential learning for corporate, professional and personal development.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chiefexecutive.com/display_article.asp?id=1410|title=  Why Talk to a Guru - When You Can Whisper to a Horse|accessdate=2008-07-08 |author= The Academy for Chief Executives|work= Articles}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=September 2009}}  There are also experimental programs using horses in [[prison]] settings.
