'''Saint-Étienne''' is a city in eastern central France.

It lies 60&nbsp;km (40 miles) southwest of [[Lyon]] in the [[Rhône-Alpes]] [[région in France|region]] and is the capital of the Loire département. It is situated in the [[Massif Central]].

==Geography==
The town is situated on the trunk road that connects [[Toulouse]] with [[Lyon]] through the Massif Central.

==History==
[[File:Musée d'art et d'industrie de saint Etienne.jpg|left|thumb|Musée d'art et d'industrie.]]
The city was named after [[Saint Stephen]]. From the sixteenth century, Saint-Étienne developed an arms manufacturing industry. It was this which accounted for the town's importance, although it also became a centre for the manufacture of [[ribbons]] and [[passementerie]] starting in the 17th century. During the [[French revolution]], Saint-Étienne was briefly renamed '''Armeville''' - 'arms town' - because of this activity.

Later, it became a coal mining centre, and more recently, has been known for its bicycle industry.

In the first half of the 19th century, it was only a chief town of an arrondissement in the ''{{Lang|fr|département}}'' of the Loire, with a population of 33,064 in 1832. The concentration of industry prompted these numbers to rise rapidly to 110,000 by about 1880. It was this growing importance of Saint-Étienne that led to its being made seat of the prefecture and the departmental administration on 25 July 1855, when it became the chief town in the ''{{Lang|fr|département}}'' and seat of the prefect, usurping the position hitherto belonging to [[Montbrison, Loire|Montbrison]]. The latter was reduced to the status of chief town of an arrondissement. Saint-Étienne absorbed the commune of [[Valbenoîte]] and several other neighbouring localities on 31 March 1855.

In 1990, Saint-Étienne set up the design [[biennale]] which is the largest of its kind in France. The next convention is in 2010. It also launched the [[Massenet Festival]]s, (the place of birth of the composer) devoted mainly to perform his [[opera]]s.

==Culture==
{{Expand|date=March 2009}}
<!--Cathedral and Castle should be mentioned at least!!!-->
The city is home to three museums, of which the Musée d'Art Moderne has one of the largest collections of modern and contemporary art in France. The other two main museums in Saint-Etienne are Musée de la Mine and Musée des Ponts et Chaussées.

==Demographics==
Population of the city at the 1999 census was 180,210 (177,300 as of February 2004 estimates). Population of the whole metropolitan area at the 1999 census was 321,703.

Inhabitants of Saint-Étienne are called ''stéphanois'' in French. They are named so because "Étienne" derives from the Greek ''Stephanos''.

==Sport==
The city's football club [[AS Saint-Étienne]] has won the [[Ligue 1]] title a record ten times.

St. Étienne was the capital of the French [[bicycle]] industry. The [[bicycle wheel]] manufacturer [[Mavic]] is based in the city and frame manufacturers [[Motobécane]] and [[Vitus (bicycles)|Vitus]] are also based here. The city often hosts a stage of the [[Tour de France]].

St. Étienne resident [[Thierry Gueorgiou]] is a world champion in [[orienteering]].

==Transport==
Saint-Étienne is also notable for its [[Tramway de Saint Etienne]] tram system (which uniquely with Lille, it kept throughout the 20th century).

Bus and tram transport is regulated and provided by the [[Société de Transports de l'Agglomération Stéphanoise|STAS]], a [[Passenger Transport Executive|public transport executive]] organisationss.
