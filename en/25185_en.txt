'''Q''' is the seventeenth letter of the [[basic modern Latin alphabet]]. Its name in [[English language|English]] ({{pron-en|ˈkjuː}}<!--Do not transcribe this /kjʰuː/. Aspiration is not phonemic in English.-->) is spelled '''cue'''.<ref>"Q" ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' 2nd edition (1989); ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1993); "que," op. cit.</ref>

The [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] sound value of [[Qoph|Qôp]] (perhaps originally ''qaw'', "cord of wool", and possibly based on an [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]) was {{IPA|/q/}} ([[voiceless uvular plosive]]), a sound common to Semitic languages, but not found in English or most Indo-European ones. In [[Greek language|Greek]], this sign as [[Qoppa]] {{Unicode|Ϙ}} probably came to represent several [[labiovelar|labialized velar]] [[plosive]]s, among them {{IPA|/kʷ/}} and {{IPA|/kʷʰ/}}. As a result of later sound shifts, these sounds in Greek changed to {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/pʰ/}} respectively. Therefore, Qoppa was transformed into two letters: Qoppa, which stood for a number only, and [[Phi (letter)|Phi]] Φ which stood for the aspirated sound {{IPA|/pʰ/}} that came to be pronounced {{IPA|/f/}} in Modern Greek. 

In the earliest [[Latin]] inscriptions, the letters C, K and Q were all used to represent the sounds /k/ and /g/ (which were not differentiated in writing).  Of these, Q was used to represent /k/ or /g/ before a rounded vowel (e.g. "EQO" = ''ego''), K before /a/, and C elsewhere.  Later, the use of C (and its variant G) replaced most usages of K and Q:  Q survived only to represent /k/ when immediately followed by a /w/ sound.<ref>{{cite book

The [[Etruscans]] used Q only in conjunction with V to represent {{IPA|/kʷ/}}

== Usage ==
In most modern western languages written in Latin script, such as in [[Romance language|Romance]] and [[Germanic languages]], Q appears almost exclusively in the digraph QU, though see [[List of English words containing Q not followed by U|Q without U]]. In [[English language|English]] this digraph most often denotes the cluster {{IPA|/kw/}}, except in borrowings from French where it represents {{IPA|/k/}} as in ''plaque''. In [[Italian language|Italian]] qu represents {{IPA|/kw/}} (where {{IPA|/w/}} is the [[semivowel]] allophone of {{IPA|/u/}}); in German, {{IPA|/kv/}}; and in [[French language|French]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/kw/}}; in the same languages ''qu'' replaces [[c]] for {{IPA|/k/}} before front vowels [[i]] and [[e]], since in those contexts ''c'' is a fricative and letter 'k' is seldom used outside [[loan word]]s.) [[Danish language|Danish]] abolished the letter in 1872, although it's still part of the alphabet. A consequence of this was the change in spelling of the word 'kvinde' (woman), which prior to 1872 was spelt 'Quinde'. As a result the term 'kvinde med q' (woman spelt with q) is used for an old-fashioned woman, whilst 'kvinde med k' is used about a modern woman.

In the [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Aleut language|Aleut]], [[Yupik language|Yup'ik]], [[Inuit language|Inuit]], [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Quechua]], and [[Tatar language]]s, as well as [[Romanization of Arabic|romanised]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Q is a [[voiceless uvular plosive]]. {{IPA|[q]}} is also used in the [[help:IPA|IPA]] for the voiceless uvular plosive, as well as in most transliteration schemes of [[Semitic languages]] for the "emphatic" ''[[Qoph|qōp]]'' sound. The sound is rendered with letter ﻕ in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]].

In [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[Võro language|Võro]], Q denotes the [[glottal stop]].

In [[Albanian language|Albanian]], ''q'' represents the [[voiceless palatal plosive]], {{IPA|/c/}}. 

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Hanyu Pinyin]], Q is used to represent the sound {{IPA|[tɕʰ]}}, which is close to English "ch" in "cheese".

In [[Fijian language|Fijian]], Q represents the [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]] [[voiced velar plosive]] {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}}.

In [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], Q represents the [[postalveolar click]] {{IPA|[kǃ]}}.

In [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]], Q represents a glottalized velar plosive, {{IPA|/kʼ/}}.

Q, which is rarely seen in a word without a U next to it in English, is the second most rarely used letter in the [[English language]]. The Q represents a voiceless velar plosive, contrary to the belief that it represents a labialized voiceless velar plosive. If this were the case, there would be no need for the "U" at the end.

The lowercase Q is usually seen as a lowercase O with a descender (i.e., downward vertical tail) extending from the right side of the bowl, with or without a swash (i.e., flourish). The lowercase Q's descender is usually typed without a swash due to the major style difference typically seen between the descenders of the lowercase G (a loop) and lowercase Q (vertical). The descender of the lowercase Q is usually handwritten finishing with a rightward swash to distinguish from the leftward facing curved descender on the lowercase G.{{-}}
