'''Aykut Barka''' (December 16, 1951 &ndash; February 1, 2002) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Earth science|Earth scientist]]. He is best known for his contributions to understanding the behaviour of the [[North Anatolian Fault Zone]] (NAFZ), one of the most dangerous active [[Geologic fault|faults]] in the world. 

==Biography==
He was born in [[Fatih]] district of [[Istanbul]] in 1951. He received his [[PhD]] degree in 1981 from the [[University of Bristol]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] under the supervision of Dr. P.L. Hancock with a thesis on "''Seismotectonic Aspects of the North Anatolian Fault Zone''".

He worked and studied geosciences in some top rated institutions around the world, including [[Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris]], [[École Normale Supérieure]] [[Paris]], [[MIT]] [[Earth Resources Laboratory]], [[Cambridge, MA]], University of Bristol, UK and [[Geological Survey of Japan]].

In 1997, Barka published a [http://atlas.cc.itu.edu.tr/~barka/pubs/anatolia/anatolia.html paper] with Ross Stein and James H. Dieterich of [[USGS]], titled ''"Progressive failure on the [[North Anatolian Fault]] since 1939 by earthquake stress triggering"'', which showed the migration of big earthquakes and, not surprisingly, positive stress accumulation in the [[Sea of Marmara|Marmara Region]]. Only 2 years after this paper was published, [[1999 Izmit, Turkey Earthquake|a Magnitude 7.4 earthquake hit the Izmit area ]] in Marmara, killing more than 20,000 people. 

Aykut Barka died on [[February 1]], [[2002]] from injuries suffered in a car accident five weeks earlier. He left a wife and two young children.
