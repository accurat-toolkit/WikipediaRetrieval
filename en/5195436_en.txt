{{Latin alphabet navbox|uc=J|lc=j}}

'''J''' is the tenth letter in the [[basic modern Latin alphabet]]; it was the last of the 26 letters to be added. Its name in [[English language|English]] ({{pron-en|ˈdʒeɪ}}) is spelled '''jay'''.<ref name="j-oed">"J", ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' 2nd edition (1989)</ref><ref> "J" and "jay", ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1993)</ref> It was formerly ''jy'' (from French ''ji'') and still is in some dialects, mainly in [[Scottish English]], where it is {{pron-en|ˈdʒaɪ}}.<ref name="j-oed"/>

==History==
'''J''' was originally used as a [[swash (typography)|swash]] character to end some [[Roman numerals]] in place of ''i''. There was an emerging distinctive use in [[Middle High German]].<ref>[http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/lexer/selectarticle?lemid=LJ00001 Mittelhochdeutsches Handwörterbuch von Matthias Lexer (1878)]</ref> [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]] ([[1478]]-[[1550]]) was the first to explicitly distinguish I and J as representing separate sounds, in his ''Ɛpistola del Trissino de le lettere nuωvamente aggiunte ne la lingua italiana'' ("Trissino's epistle about the letters recently added in the Italian language") of [[1524]]<ref>[http://hal9000.cisi.unito.it/wf/BIBLIOTECH/Umanistica/Biblioteca2/Libri-anti1/Libri-anti/image230.pdf Ɛpistola del Trissino de le lettere nuωvamente aggiunte ne la lingua italiana, photographic reproduction by Turin Univerisity], page 5 of PDF file; publishing date in on the last page.</ref>. Originally, both I and J represented {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}}, and {{IPA|/j/}}; but [[Romance languages]] developed new sounds (from former {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}) that came to be represented as I and J; therefore, [[English language|English]] J (from [[French language|French]] J) has a sound value quite different from {{IPA|/j/}} (which represents the sound in the English word "'''y'''et").

==Use in English==
In English J most commonly represents the [[affricate]] {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (as in '''j'''et).  In [[Old English]] the phoneme {{IPA|/dʒ/}} was represented orthographically as ''cʒ''.<ref name="hogg"/>  Under the influence of Old French, which had a similar phoneme deriving from Latin {{IPA|/j/}}, English scribes began to use ''I'' (later ''J'') to represent word-initial {{IPA|/dʒ/}} of Old English (for example, '''''i'''est'', later '''''j'''est''), while using ''DG'' elsewhere (for example, ''he'''dg'''e'').<ref name="hogg"/>  Later many other uses of ''I'' (later ''J'') were added in loan words from French and other languages (e.g. ''ad'''j'''oin'', '''''j'''unta'').  The first English-language book to make a clear distinction between ''I'' and ''J'' was published in 1634.<ref name="hogg">

</ref>  In loanwords such as ''raj'', "J" may be pronounced {{IPA|/ʒ/}} by some, but not all, speakers.  In some such cases, including ''raj'', ''Taj Mahal'' and others, the regular {{IPA|/dʒ/}} is actually closer to the original sound of the foreign language, making this realization a [[hyperforeignism]].<ref>

</ref>  Occasionally ''J'' represents other sounds, as in [[Hallelujah]] which is pronounced the same as "Halleluyah" (See the [[yodh|Hebrew yud]] for more details).

J is used relatively infrequently in the [[English Language]], though it is more commonly used than [[Q]], [[X]] or [[Z]].

==Uses in transcription and transliteration==

Linguists from Germany and Central Europe also took up this letter in transliterations from those Slavic languages which use the Cyrillic alphabet. Specifically, the "[[Ye (Cyrillic)|Е]]" in [[Russian language|Russian]] is sometimes transliterated "je" (with the "[[Yo (Cyrillic)|Ё]]" becoming "jo"); the "[[Ya (Cyrillic)|Я]]" is transliterated as "ja"; and the character "[[Yu (Cyrillic)|Ю]]" is transliterated "ju" - whereas the linguists from the English speaking world use "y" in place of "j" because of English, French, and Spanish use of Y for {{IPA|/j/}}. European linguists also use "j" for the character [[Short I|Й]] so that e.g. "-ий", a common adjective ending, is transliterated as "-ij". In English transliterations, that ending may be rendered as "-iy" or "-ii". Language students have to learn to find their way among the different possibilities indicated, either by the "j" or by the "y".

In the [[Pinyin]] system of transcription of [[Mandarin Chinese]], J represents the palato-alevolar affricate {{IPA|/tɕ/}}.

==Codes for computing==

In [[Unicode]] the [[majuscule|capital]] J is codepoint U+004A and the [[Lower case|lowercase]] j is U+006A. Unicode also has a dotless variant, {{Unicode|ȷ}} (U+0237) for use with [[combining diacritics]].

The [[ASCII]] code for capital J is 74 and for lowercase j is 106; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01001010 and 01101010, respectively.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital J is 209 and for lowercase j is 145.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are "<tt>&amp;#74;</tt>" and "<tt>&amp;#106;</tt>" for upper and lower case respectively.
