The '''Brisbane River''' is the longest river in [[South East Queensland|southeast]] [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], and flows through the city of [[Brisbane]], before emptying into [[Moreton Bay]]. The river is dammed by the [[Wivenhoe Dam]], forming Lake Wivenhoe, the main water supply for Brisbane. The river was named after the [[Governors of New South Wales|Governor of New South Wales]] [[Thomas Brisbane]] by the explorer [[John Oxley]] in 1823.

The [[CityCat]] ferry service collects and delivers passengers along the inner-city reaches of the river. The [[Port of Brisbane]] manages the movement of larger vessels into the river from the bay.

==History==
[[Image:BrisbaneRiver02 gobeirne-edit1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of Brisbane and the Brisbane River]]
Before European settlement, the Brisbane River was a vital food source for the Aboriginal people of the [[Turrbal]] Nation. The Turrbal people were fishing people. The river was also important to the Turrbal people for spiritual and recreational activities.

Four European [[navigators]], namely [[Captain Cook]], [[Matthew Flinders]], [[John Bingle]] and [[William Edwardson]], all visited Moreton Bay but failed to discover the river. The exploration by Flinders took place during his expedition from [[Port Jackson]] north to [[Hervey Bay]] in 1799. He spent a total of 15 days in the area, touching down at Woody Point several other spots, but failed to discover the mouth of the river although there were suspicions of its existence. This is consistent with accounts of many other rivers along the east coast of [[Australia]], which could not be found by seaward exploration but were discovered by inland travellers.<ref>[http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Life-of-Captain-Matthew-Flinders3.html The Life of Captain Matthew Flinders]</ref>

On 21 March 1823, four ticket-of-leave convicts sailed south from Sydney bound for Illawarra on a timber getting mission. Their names were [[Thomas Pamphlett]], [[John Finnegan]], [[Richard Parsons (convict)|Richard Parsons]] and [[John Thompson (convict)|John Thompson]]. Caught in a storm which took them out to sea, they were blown north instead and went 21 days without water, during which time Thompson died. They landed on [[Moreton Island]] on 16 April and made it to the mainland on the south of the Brisbane River. They immediately began trekking north in order to return to Sydney, still believing themselves to be somewhere south of Jervis Bay.<ref>Field's New South Wales, p.89 (published 1825)</ref> Subsequently they became the first known Europeans to discover the river, stumbling across it somewhere near the entrance. They walked upstream along its banks for nearly a month before making their first crossing at 'Canoe Reach', the junction of Oxley Creek. It was here they 'procured' a small canoe.

[[John Oxley]] was Surveyor General of [[New South Wales]] when, in the same year and under orders from Governor Brisbane, he sailed into [[Moreton Bay]] looking for a suitable new site for a convict settlement to be established. An entry in Oxley's diary on 19 November 1823 describes his surprise meeting with one of the shipwrecked men:
:"We rounded the Point Skirmish about 5 o'clock and observed a number of natives running along the beach towards the vessel, the foremost much lighter in colour than the rest. We were to the last degree astonished when he came abreast the vessel to hear him hail us in good English."
By that time Pamplett and Finnegan were living with natives near [[Bribie Island]]. Parsons, who had continued to travel north in search of Sydney, was never heard of again.

On the 2 December 1823, Oxley and Stirling, with Finnegan as a somewhat reluctant guide, entered the river and sailed began to said upstream until they came as far as present-day [[Goodna, Queensland|Goodna]].<ref>[[#refMcLeod1990|McLeod]], p. 191.</ref><ref>[http://www.ourindooroopilly.com/brisbane-history.html Brief History of Brisbane City in the 19th Century]
</ref> Oxley noted the abundant [[fish]] and tall [[pine tree]]s. Early European explorers marvelled at the sheer natural beauty they witnessed while travelling up the lower reaches. Reports by early European explorers such as Allan Cunningham and Oxley indicate rainforest once fringed the Brisbane River and its major tributaries, especially on the broader floodplains such as St. Lucia and Seventeen Mile Rock. The coastal lowlands were extensively vegetated with [[Melaleuca]] woodlands in low lying, poorly drained coastal areas. When first described by Europeans, the lower reaches of the Brisbane River were fringed by a mosaic of open forest, closed forest and rainforest.<ref>Young, 1990 in Task M2 State of the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay and Waterways - Gutteridge, Haskins & Davey Pty Ltd, p. 6 - 8 1996</ref>

In the same year of 1823, the river was named after [[Thomas Brisbane|Sir Thomas Brisbane]], the then [[Governors of New South Wales|Governor of New South Wales]].

[[Image:Pacificsunendeavour.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Portside Wharf]], the [[HM Bark Endeavour]] and Pacific Sun cruise ship]]
Upon the establishment of a local settlement in 1824, other explorers such as [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Allan Cunningham]], [[Patrick Logan]] and [[Edmund Lockyer|Major Edmund Lockyer]] made expeditions and surveys further upstream, and, in 1825, the Moreton Bay penal colony at [[Redcliffe, Queensland|Redcliffe]] relocated to [[North Quay, Brisbane|North Quay]].<ref name="#refMcLeod1990|McLeod, p. 192">[[#refMcLeod1990|McLeod]], p. 192.</ref>

The first small private wharves were built on the river in about 1848.<ref>[[#refMcLeod1990|McLeod]], p. 197.</ref> and the once popular, shark-proof river baths were first built in 1857 at Kangaroo Point.<ref>[[#reflonghurst|Longhurst]], p. 7.</ref>

From 1862 the Brisbane River has been dredged for navigation purposes.<ref>Wayne Erskine. 1990. "Environmental Impacts of sand and gravel extraction on river systems". In Peter Davie, Errol Stock, Darryl Low Choy (Ed.), The Brisbane river: a source-book for the future. pp. 295 - 302. Australian Littoral Society in association with the Queensland Museum.</ref> Throughout much of the 20th century large quantities of [[sand]] and [[gravel]] were extracted from the estuary of the river. Since the rate of materials being deposited is not as high as that which was removed, the river has acted as a subaqueous [[mining|mine]].

In 1866 there was a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] built at the junction of the Bremer and Brisbane rivers that was designed to stop shingle from blocking the access to the Bremer's boat channel. The first [[pile lighthouse|pile light]] using [[kerosene]] was built in 1882.<ref>[[#refMcLeod1990|McLeod]], p. 198.</ref> The [[steel]] framed light also served as an early port [[signal station]].

===20th century===
For some time the growth and settlement of Brisbane has adversely impacted the Brisbane River. By 1928 the water quality had deteriorated to the point where several [[public bath]]s had to cease sourcing water from the river.<ref>[[#reflonghurst|Longhurst]], p. 3.</ref>

Even up to the 1930s, the water was very clear, with reports of people seeing the river bed 5 or 6&nbsp;m below the surface. Swimming was once popular at Oxley Point under the Walter Taylor Bridge.<ref name="cm5">{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,24948099-3044,00.html |title=Anglers still hooked on Brisbane River |accessdate=2009-10-25 |date=22 January 2009 |work=[[Courier Mail]] |publisher=[[Queensland Newspapers]] }}</ref> In the middle tidal reaches today, visibility is about 0.2m.<ref>Young, 1990 in Task M2 State of the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay and Waterways - Gutteridge, Haskins & Davey Pty Ltd, p. 6 - 2 1996</ref> As Brisbane grew, the river became a handy open sewer and waste dump.

===Navigation===
There has been much dredging and widening work done over the years to allow [[ships]] to transport [[cargo]] to and from Brisbane. The river has served as an important carriageway between Brisbane and Ipswich before a [[railway]] linking the towns was built in 1875.<ref name="#refMcLeod1990|McLeod, p. 192"/> By early 1825 [[buoy]]s were being laid along the South Passage and shortly after that the first pilots were commissioned to guide ships entering from Moreton Bay and another service for those travelling upstream.<ref>[[#refMcLeod1990|McLeod]], p. 196.</ref> Flying boats used the waters of the river in [[Pinkenba, Queensland|Pinkenba]], to take-off for domestic and international destinations in the 1930s.<ref>[[#reflonghurst|Longhurst]], p. 20.</ref>
[[Image:Goodwill-Bridge-and-the-CityCat.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Goodwill Bridge, Brisbane|Goodwill Bridge]] and [[CityCat]] from [[Victoria Bridge, Brisbane|Victoria Bridge]].]]
The river depth was progressively increased and narrow points widened to allow larger vessels into the river and further upstream. For navigation and safety reasons the Seventeen Mile Rocks were completely removed in 1965 after numerous partially successful attempts in the past. The northern river bank at the mouth of the river has undergone reclamation projects over the years, especially in the suburbs of [[Hamilton, Queensland|Hamilton]] and [[Pinkenba, Queensland|Pinkenba]]. More recently, extensive port facilities have been constructed on Fisherman's Island which has also seen significant [[land reclamation]] into the bay.

Early rivers crossings were made using small oared boat [[ferry|ferries]], beginning in 1843 <ref>[[#reflonghurst|Longhurst]], p. 5.</ref>, followed by steam ferries. In 1865 the first [[Victoria Bridge, Brisbane|Victoria Bridge]], later destroyed in a flood, was built across the river. Professor [[Roger Hawken|Hawken]] of the [[University of Queensland]] undertook a study in 1914 to identify the future crossing points for the river.

Historically, the Brisbane River contained upstream bars and shallows and has a natural tidal limit of only 16 km. The current tidal limit now extends 85 km upstream due to continual channel dredging.<ref>Liz OâBrien, Paul Maxwell, Ivan Holland, Angela Grice and Dieter Tracey âTidal Brisbane Riverâ Chapter 12 in State of South-east Queensland Waterways Report 2001 Moreton Bay Waterways and Catchments Partnership, p.75</ref>

Brisbane River's source is located in the [[Brisbane Range]], east of [[Kingaroy, Queensland|Kingaroy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} It then makes its way south, past Mount Stanley, and townships including [[Moore, Queensland|Moore]] and [[Toogoolawah, Queensland|Toogoolawah]] before being joined by the [[Stanley River (Queensland)|Stanley River]], just south of Somerset Dam. The river runs from there into Lake Wivenhoe, created by the Wivenhoe Dam. Beyond the dam, the river meanders eastward, meeting the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] near [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]], then making its way through Brisbane's western suburbs, including [[Jindalee, Queensland|Jindalee]], [[Indooroopilly, Queensland|Indooroopilly]] and [[Toowong, Queensland|Toowong]]. Through the city, the river is travelled upon by [[CityCat]]s and other [[Brisbane Ferries|ferries in Brisbane]], winding its way through the city centre. The Brisbane River then flows through the [[Port of Brisbane]] area and out into [[Moreton Bay]].

===Kangaroo Point Cliffs===
On the southern side of the river, opposite [[Gardens Point, Brisbane|Gardens Point]], are the [[Kangaroo Point Cliffs]]. The Kangaroo Point Cliffs were created by a quarrying operation that according to Allan Cunninghams' Field Book, was underway prior to 1829 when he observed a "stone wharf presumably used for landing the blocks of stone ferried across the river for the construction of buildings in the settlement" this was in the vicinity of [[Edward Street, Brisbane|Edward Street]] ferry terminal. The [[volcanic rock]] or [[rhyolite]] [[lava]] flows which form the cliffs were deposited in the [[Tertiary]] period about 30 million years ago and filled up an ancient river valley. They currently form the banks of the Brisbane River.

The following major tributaries flow into the Brisbane River from the north; [[Breakfast Creek, Queensland|Breakfast Creek]], [[Moggill Creek, Queensland|Moggill Creek]] and the [[Stanley River, Queensland|Stanley River]]

On the southside [[Bulimba Creek, Queensland|Bulimba Creek]], [[Norman Creek]], [[Oxley Creek, Queensland|Oxley Creek]], [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] and [[Lockyer Creek, Queensland|Lockyer Creek]] waterways enter the Brisbane River.

The following smaller creeks also flow into the river; Cressbrook Creek, Cooyar Creek, Cubberla Creek, Wolston Creek, Woogaroo Creek, Goodna Creek, Six Mile Creek, Bundamba Creek, Pullen Pullen Creek and Kholo Creek.

==Crossings==
{{Main|Bridges over the Brisbane River}}

Currently the Brisbane River is crossed by 14 major bridges, including the historic [[Story Bridge, Brisbane|Story Bridge]] and the tolled [[Gateway Bridge, Brisbane|Gateway Bridge]]. There are two other major bridges upstream west of Brisbane, on the [[D'Aguilar Highway]] and the [[Brisbane Valley Highway]]. The [[Clem Jones Tunnel, Brisbane|Clem Jones Tunnel]], opening in 2009, will be the river's first underground crossing for road transport.

==Brisbane Riverwalk==
[[Image:Brisbane River Walk.JPG|thumb|left|140px|The Brisbane Riverwalk]]
The [[Brisbane City Council]] has been developing a network of [[riverwalk]] pavements along the banks of the Brisbane River.<ref>[http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/BCC:STANDARD:1840137411:pc=PC_1217 Brisbane Riverwalk]</ref> [[Jim Soorley]], a former mayor of Brisbane, encouraged serious investment into the quality and capacity of the Brisbane riverwalk. An interesting section is the floating walkway between the [[Story Bridge, Brisbane|Story Bridge]] and Merthyr Street [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]]. Brisbane City planners require many developers of formerly private riverfront blocks to create new sections of the Brisbane Riverwalk that are accessible to the public.

==Floods==
[[Image:Brisbane sat.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Landsat image of the Brisbane region <br>(showing Brisbane River)]]
[[Image:VictoriaBridge1893.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Victoria Bridge, Brisbane|Victoria Bridge]] during the 1893 flood]]

The Brisbane River floods frequently, although the occurrence and magnitude of flooding has diminished following the construction of the [[Wivenhoe Dam]] on the upper reaches of the River.

Past floods have resulted in both deepening and reduction in river depth, creation of new [[sand bank]]s and [[shoal]]s as well as increased transport of suspended sediment from upstream. Before the invention of modern [[dredging]] techniques the [[sediment]] deposited by flooding created [[hazard]]s to ships navigating the river. Even medium sized vessels no longer travel up the Brisbane River beyond the city reach, and dredging of the upper reaches has ceased, allowing the river to recover substantially from the fine silt dislodged by gravel and sand extraction.

Significant floods have occurred several times since the European settlement of Brisbane. The most significant of these events was the [[1974 Brisbane Flood]]. Notable instances of flooding include:
* 14 January 1841 (Highest flood level to date)
* March 1890
* February 1893, a sequence of flood peaks over some three weeks saw the highest recorded flood level in the Brisbane [[central business district]]. Seven lives were lost in the Eclipse Colliery at [[North Ipswich, Queensland|North Ipswich]] as a direct result of the flooding. Several other lives were lost to drownings.
* February 1931
* 27 January 1974 (Largest flood to affect Brisbane City in the 20th Century).

Flooding along the Brisbane River has the potential to be devastating. For much of the river's length its banks are relatively high, but topped by a broad plain. The river's sinuous course means that flood waters from upstream cannot be quickly discharged into Moreton Bay. Thus higher than normal flows cause river levels to rise rapidly and once the top of the banks are breached the floodwaters can spread over wide areas of the city.

==Environmental concerns==
During the 1800s and early 20th century, the river's surface was periodically choked by large swathes of the noxious weed known as [[water hyacinth]]. The plant was originally imported from South America.<ref>{{cite book |title=Brisbane's Western Suburbs: our heritage in focus |last=Meadows |first=Jane |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher=State Library of Queensland Foundation |location= |isbn=0724260773 |pages=87 }}</ref>

Environmentally, the river is in a poor condition and has been so for many years. In 2000, the Brisbane River estuary did not meet the national guidelines for environmental standards.<ref name="sgnrm">{{cite book |title=Strategic Guide to Natural Resource Management in South East Queensland  |last=South East Queensland Regional Strategic Group |year=2000 |publisher= |location= |isbn=0734517408 |pages=56 }}</ref> The lower reaches received a very poor rating in the 2008 Healthy Waterways report, an annual assessment of river water quality.<ref name="cm5"/> The major causes of [[pollution]] are excess nutrients, [[hydrocarbons]], [[pesticides]] and [[bacteria]] which become concentrated in the river and its [[sediment]] after flowing off surrounding lands. This river is also considered too murky and it is not recommended to swim in its waters.<ref>Craig Johnstone. (July 22, 1995). "How we're slowly killing our river". ''[[The Courier-Mail]] - Weekend'' p. 1</ref>

[[Image:QUT-CityCat-terminal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Mangroves]] on the Brisbane River at the [[CityCat]] [[wharf]] near the [[Queensland University of Technology|QUT]]]]
Historically, the river was actively dredged by [[Boral]] Sands Inc, ostensibly to make the river navigable. The constant extraction of river bed material by dredges has had considerable effect on the river. These impacts include increased turbidity, bed and bank erosion and changes in tidal hydraulics. The tidal nature of the river and the generally muddy nature of the sands removed by dredging created a woefully sludgy clayey sediment load in the river which did not clear. The efficacy of dredging the river upstream of the city reach to make it "navigable" was always in doubt, and the effect of the artificial sediment load in Moreton Bay grew to concern environmentalists worried that sediment was choking sea grass paddocks which were grazing territory for [[dugong]]. In a meeting concerning the matter in October 1996, including two State Government Ministers and three Mayors, an agreement to cease the dredging of sand and gravel from the river by September 30, 1997 was formed. Boral Resources Pty. Ltd. resisted the agreement, but ultimately all dredging was stopped by the agreed date.

The river has several important ecological areas where remnant populations of [[mangrove]]s exist; these include areas around drainage culverts, in Breakfast Creek, [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], a small preserve at the city bend, near the [[Queensland University of Technology]] and around the shipping terminals at the river's terminus into Moreton Bay. These mangroves have recently become classified as protected [[nature reserve]]s.

The waterway is a habitat for the rare [[Queensland lungfish]].<ref name=>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23002241-12377,00.html |title=We're green, but lungfish ain't that rare, says Lucas |author= |accessdate=2009-06-17 |date=2008-01-03 |work=[[The Australian]] |publisher=[[News Limited]] }}</ref>

===2009 Oil Spill===
''Main article: [[2009 southeast Queensland oil spill]]''

On the 11&nbsp;March&nbsp;2009 the ''[[MV Pacific Adventurer]]'' docked at the Port of Brisbane while leaking fuel, causing a 500&nbsp;m long oil slick that polluted the mouth of the river.

==Fauna==
===Brisbane River cod===
The freshwater reaches of the Brisbane River once supported a unique species of cod, the [[Brisbane River cod]] which was similar to [[Murray cod]] and closely related to [[eastern freshwater cod]]. Unfortunately this unique native fish became extinct somewhere between the 1930s and 1950's due to habitat degradation and overfishing. The river has been restocked with cod from the Mary River.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Bull sharks===
The Brisbane River is home to a very large population of [[bull sharks]], thus swimming is not advised due to the dangers imposed by this predatory fish. Ipswich City Council warns against swimming as far up as [[College's Crossing]].<ref name="cm5"/> The shark can be aggressive, grow up to 3&nbsp;m in length and is unusual for a shark species because it can inhabit water containing less than 50% seawater.<ref name=>{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=2794 |title=Brisbane River sharks net international interest |accessdate=2009-10-25 |date=20 February 2002 |work=UQ News |publisher=[[University of Queensland]] }}</ref>

==Events==
The Brisbane River hosts numerous events including the [[Riverfestival|River''festival'']], [[Riverfestival|River''fire'']] and the [[Brisbane River Classic]] fishing competition. Many schools and clubs use the river to conduct [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] regattas on Milton Reach. Sailing regattas are also held on this reach as well as the Hamilton reach.
