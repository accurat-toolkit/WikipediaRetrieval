'''Vegetarianism and religion''' are strongly linked in a number of religions that originated in ancient India ([[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]). In Jainism [[vegetarianism]] is mandatory for everyone, in Hinduism and [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] it is advocated by some influential scriptures and religious authorities.<ref>{{cite book

{{Main|Hindu vegetarianism|Hindu dietary law}}
Vegetarianism plays a strong role in Hindu tradition, although there are a wide variety of practices and beliefs that have changed over time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus K.|title=A survey of Hinduism|publisher=SUNY Press|edition=Edition: 2|pages=165|isbn=ISBN 0791421090, 9780791421093|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=avYkrkSmImcC}}</ref> It is estimated some 30% of all Hindus are vegetarian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clovegarden.com/diet/hindu.html|title=Hindu Dietary Customs|last=Grygus|first=Andrew |date=2007|accessdate=2009-06-13}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=June 2009}}.

====Nonviolence====
[[File:Indianfoodleaf.jpg|thumb|A variety [[South Indian cuisine|South Indian]] dishes served on a banana leaf.]]
The principle of [[nonviolence]] applied to animals is connected with the intention to avoid negative [[Karma|karmic]] influences which result from violence. The suffering of all beings is believed to arise from craving and desire, conditioned by the karmic effects of both animal and human action. The violence of slaughtering animals for food, and its source in craving, reveal flesh eating as one mode in which humans enslave themselves to suffering.<ref name="Walters, Kerry S 2001. p.41, 42">Walters, Kerry S. and Portmess, Lisa. Religious Vegetarianism: From Hesiod to the Dalai Lama. State University of New York Press. New York, 2001. p.41, 42, 61, 62, 187, 191. ISBN 0-7914-4972-6.</ref> Hinduism holds that such influences affect he who permits the slaughter of an animal, he who cuts it up, he who kills it, he who buys or sells meat, he who cooks it, he who serves it up, and he who eats it. They must all be considered the slayers of the animal.<ref name="Walters, Kerry S 2001. p.41, 42"/>  The question of religious duties towards the animals and of negative Karma incurred from violence (''himsa'') against them is discussed in detail in Hindu scriptures and religious law books.

Hindu scriptures belong or refer to the [[Vedic period]] which lasted till about 500 BCE according to the chronological division by modern historians. In the [[historical Vedic religion]], the predecessor of Hinduism, meat eating was not banned in principle, but was restricted by specific rules. Several highly authoritative scriptures bar violence against domestic animals except in the case of ritual sacrifice. This view is clearly expressed in the [[Mahabharata]] (3.199.11-12<ref>Mahabharata 3.199 is 3.207 according to another count.</ref>; 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17), the [[Bhagavata Purana]] (11.5.13-14), and the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (8.15.1). It is also reflected in the [[Manu Smriti]] (5.27-44), a particularly renowned traditional Hindu law book ([[Dharmaśāstra]]). These texts strongly condemn the slaughter of animals and meat eating unless it happens in the context of the appropriate sacrifice ritual administered by priests. The Mahabharata allows people who are warriors by profession ([[Kshatriya]]s) to hunt and to eat meat "acquired by expenditure of prowess" (13.115.59-60; 13.116.15-18), but opposes such activities in the case of hermits who must be strictly nonviolent.<ref>Alsdorf p. 592-593.</ref>

The Mahabharata (12.260<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b095.htm Mahabharata 12.260]. Mahabharata 12.260 is 12.268 according to another count.</ref>; 13.115-116; 14.28) and the Manu Smriti (5.27-55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter and subsequent consumption of the meat. In the Mahabharata both meat eaters and vegetarians present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Apart from the debates about domestic animals, there is also a long discourse by a hunter in defence of hunting and meat eating.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03207.htm Mahabharata 3.199]. Mahabharata 3.199 is 3.207 according to another count.</ref> These texts show that both ritual slaughter and hunting were challenged by advocates of universal non-violence and their acceptability was doubtful and a matter of dispute.<ref>Alsdorf p. 572-577 (for the Manu Smriti) and p. 585-597 (for the Mahabharata).</ref> In modern Hinduism slaughter according to the rituals permitted in the Vedic scriptures has virtually disappeared.

====Spiritual aspects====
In some traditions, especially within [[Vaishnavism]], it is essential that devotees offer all their food to their chosen [[deity]] before eating it as [[prasad]].<ref>[http://vedabase.net/bg/3/13/en1 Bhagavad Gita 3.13].</ref> This rule is strictly observed by the disciples of the schools of [[Bhakti Yoga]], especially the [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavas]]. They worship [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]], and according to the scriptural injunctions they obey, only vegetarian food is acceptable as prasad.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b092.htm Mahabharata 12.257] (note that Mahabharata 12.257 is 12.265 according to another count); Bhagavad Gita 9.26; Bhagavata Purana 7.15.7.</ref>

Vegetarianism is also mandatory for the practitioners of [[Hatha Yoga]].<ref>[[Gherand Samhita]] 5.17-21.</ref> They follow the advice of scriptures such as the [[Bhagavad Gita]]<ref> [http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/17/en1 Bhagavad Gita 17.7-10].</ref> to eat only high-quality food, because they are convinced that food shapes the personality, mood and mind. Meat is said to promote sloth and ignorance and an undesirable mental state known as ''[[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'', while a vegetarian diet is considered to promote the desirable ''[[Sattvic diet|sattvic]]'' qualities essential for spiritual progress.

====Essential scriptural evidence====
<blockquote>
"What need there be said of those innocent and healthy creatures endued with love of life, when they are sought to be slain by sinful wretches subsisting by slaughter? For this reason, [[Yudhishthira|O monarch]], know that the discarding of meat is the highest refuge of religion, of heaven, and of happiness. Abstention from injury is the highest religion. It is, again, the highest penance. It is also the highest truths from which all duty proceeds. Flesh cannot be had from grass or wood or stone. Unless a living creature is slain, it cannot be had. Hence is the fault in eating flesh. … That man who abstains from meat, is never put in fear, O king, by any creature. All creatures seek his protection. He never causes any anxiety in others, and himself has never to become anxious. If there were nobody who ate flesh there would then be nobody to kill living creatures. The man who kills living creatures kill them for the sake of the person who eats flesh. If flesh were regarded as inedible, there would then be no slaughter of living creatures. It is for the sake of the eater that the slaughter of living creatures goes on in the world. Since, O thou of great splendour, the period of life is shortened of persons who slaughter living creatures or cause them to be slaughtered, it is clear that the person who wishes his own good should give up meat entirely. … The purchaser of flesh performs ''himsa'' [violence] by his wealth; he who eats flesh does so by enjoying its taste; the killer does ''himsa'' by actually tying and killing the animal. Thus, there are three forms of killing. He who brings flesh or sends for it, he who cuts off the limbs of an animal, and he who purchases, sells, or cooks flesh and eats it - all of these are to be considered meat-eaters." ([[Mahabharata]] 13.115)<ref>[http://www.mahabharataonline.com/translation/mahabharata_13b080.php Mahabharata 13.115].</ref>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Those sinful persons who are ignorant of actual religious principles, yet consider themselves to be completely pious, without compunction commit violence against innocent animals who are fully trusting in them. In their next lives, such sinful persons will be eaten by the same creatures they have killed in this world." ([[Bhagavata Purana]] 11.5.14)<ref> [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/11/5/14/en1 Bhagavata Purana 11.5.14].</ref>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"A person fully aware of religious principles should never offer anything like meat, eggs or fish in the [[Sraddha]] ceremony, and even if one is a [[Ksatriya]] (warrior), he himself should not eat such things." (Bhagavata Purana 7.15.7)<ref> [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/15/7/en1 Bhagavata Purana 7.15.7].</ref>
</blockquote>

====Current situation====
In modern India the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community or caste and according to regional traditions. Hindu vegetarians usually eschew eggs but consume milk and [[dairy product]]s, so they are [[Lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarians]].

According to a survey of 2006, vegetarianism is weak in coastal states and strong in landlocked northern and western states and among [[Brahmin]]s in general, 55 percent of whom are vegetarians.<ref name=Food_habits_of_a_nation>{{cite news | author = Yadav, Y.| coauthors= Kumar, S|title =  The food habits of a nation| url = http://www.thehindu.com/2006/08/14/stories/2006081403771200.htm | work = The Hindu | date = [[August 14]], [[2006]]|accessdate = 2006-11-17 }}</ref> Many coastal habitants are fish eaters. In particular [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Hindus have romanticized fishermen and the consumption of fish through poetry, literature and music.

In India, latest reports indicate that meat consumption is actually going up <ref>http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/increased-meat-consumption-in-india-china-driving-global-food-prices-eu_10045826.html</ref>.

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhist vegetarianism}}
The [[The Five Precepts|first lay precept]] in [[Buddhism]] prohibits killing.<ref>[http://web.singnet.com.sg/~alankhoo/Precepts.htm#Killing Leading a Buddhist Life - Five Precepts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Unlike the Biblical commandment (Thou Shalt Not Kill), which Jewish and Christian authorities have typically applied only to human beings, the First Precept has always been held to apply to animals as well as humans.<ref name="Phelps, Norm 2004. p.XIII, 31">Phelps, Norm. The Great Compassion: Buddhism & Animal Rights. Lantern Books. New York, 2004. p.XIII, 31, 32, 34, 49, 61, 62, 65, 85, 147. ISBN 1-59056-069-8.</ref> Many see this as implying that Buddhists should not eat the meat of animals. There are however differing points of view. The Buddha made distinction between killing an animal and consumption of meat, stressing that it is immoral conduct that makes one impure, not the food one eats. At one point the Buddha specifically refused to institute vegetarianism. There were, however, rules prohibiting certain types of meat, such as human, [[leopard]] or [[elephant]]. Monks are also prohibited from consuming meat if they witnessed the animal's death or know it was killed specifically for them.<ref>[http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma3/meat.html  What the Buddha Said About Eating Meat]</ref>

On the other hand, the Buddha in certain [[Mahayana sutras]] strongly denounces the eating of meat. In the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], the Buddha states that "the eating of meat extinguishes the seed of great compassion", adding that all and every kind of meat and fish consumption (even of animals already found dead) is prohibited by him. The Buddha goes on to emphasize that meat-eating cannot coexist with the great compassion and calls for not just a vegetarian, but a vegan lifestyle.<ref name="Phelps, Norm 2004. p.XIII, 31"/> The Buddha also predicts in this sutra that later monks will "hold spurious writings to be the authentic Dharma" and will concoct their own sutras and mendaciously claim that the Buddha allows the eating of meat, whereas in fact (he says) he does not.<ref>[http://www.nirvanasutra.org.uk/mpnsvegetarianism.htm Nirvana Sutra: Appreciation of the "Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra"]</ref>·	The Lankavatara Sutra (a Mahayana scripture), in particular, devotes an entire chapter to the Buddha’s response to the request of a disciple named Mahamati to “teach us as to the merit and vice of meat-eating”.<ref name="Phelps, Norm 2004. p.XIII, 31"/> A long passage in the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] shows the Buddha weighing strongly in favor of vegetarianism, since the eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said by him to be incompatible with the compassion a [[Bodhisattva]] should strive to cultivate.<ref>[http://www.shabkar.org/scripture/sutras/lankavatara_sutra1.htm Lankavatara Sutra & The Faults of Eating Meat - 1/8]</ref> Several other Mahayana sutras also emphatically prohibit the consumption of meat.

A solution to this problem arose when monks from the Indian sphere of influence migrated to [[China]], as of the year 65 CE. There they met followers who provided them with money instead of food. From those days onwards Chinese monastics, and others who came to inhabit northern countries, cultivated their own vegetable plots and bought everything else they needed in terms of food in the market.

In the modern Buddhist world, attitudes toward vegetarianism vary by location. on China and [[Vietnam]], monks typically eat no meat (and with other restrictions as well &ndash; see [[Buddhist cuisine]]). In [[Japan]] or [[Korea]] some schools do not eat meat, while most do. Theravadins in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[South-east Asia]] do not practice vegetarianism. All Buddhists however, including monks, are allowed to practice vegetarianism if they wish to do so. Experts have estimated that worldwide about half of all Buddhists are vegetarian.<ref name="Phelps, Norm 2004. p.XIII, 31"/>

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Sikh vegetarianism}}
Followers of Sikhism do not have a preference for meat or vegetarian consumption.<ref name = "SHP">[http://www.sikhs.org/meat_au.htm "Misconceptions About Eating Meat - Comments of Sikh Scholars,"] at [http://www.sikhs.org/ The Sikhism Home Page]</ref><ref>'''Sikhs and Sikhism by I.J. Singh, Manohar, Delhi ISBN 9788173040580'''  ''Throughout Sikh history, there have been movements or subsects of Sikhism which have espoused vegetarianism. I think there is no basis for such dogma or practice in Sikhism. Certainly Sikhs do not think that a vegetarian's achievements in spirituality are easier or higher. It is surprising to see that vegetarianism is such an important facet of Hindu practice in light of the fact that animal sacrifice was a significant and much valued Hindu Vedic ritual for ages. Guru Nanak in his writings clearly rejected both sides of the arguments - on the virtues of vegetarianism or meat eating - as banal and so much nonsense, nor did he accept the idea that a cow was somehow more sacred than a horse or a chicken. He also refused to be drawn into a contention on the differences between flesh and greens, for instance. History tells us that to impart this message, Nanak cooked meat at an important Hindu festival in Kurukshetra. Having cooked it he certainly did not waste it, but probably served it to his followers and ate himself. History is quite clear that Guru Hargobind and Guru Gobind Singh were accomplished and avid hunters. The game was cooked and put to good use, to throw it away would have been an awful waste''.</ref><ref> '''Guru Granth Sahib, An Analytical Study by Surindar Singh Kohli, Singh Bros.

May be, it is on account of its being, perhaps, expensive, or not easy to keep for long. Or, perhaps the Vaishnava tradition is too strong to be shaken off.'' </ref> There are two views on initiated or "Amritdhari Sikhs" and meat consumption. "Amritdhari" Sikhs (i.e. those that follow the [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]] (the Official Sikh Code of Conduct<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sgpc.net/sikhism/sikh-dharma-manual.html |title=Sikh Reht Maryada, The Definition of Sikh, Sikh Conduct & Conventions, Sikh Religion Living, India |publisher=www.sgpc.net |accessdate=2009-08-29 }}</ref>) can eat meat (provided it is not [[Kutha meat]])."Amritdharis" that belong to some Sikh sects (eg [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]], [[Damdami Taksal]], [[Namdhari]],<ref>[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/2007/4-6/18-32_veggie.shtml Vegetarianism and Meat-Eating in 8 Religions] April/May/June, 2007 [[Hinduism Today]]</ref> Rarionwalay,<ref>'''Philosophy of Sikhism by Gyani Sher Singh (Ph.D), Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee.

Kabir far from defying Brahmanical tradition as to the eating of meat, would not permit so much, as the plucking of a flower (G.G.S. pg 479), whereas Nanak deemed all such scruples to be superstitions, Kabir held the doctrine of Ahinsa or the non-destruction of life, which extended even to that of flowers. The Sikh Gurus, on the contrary, allowed and even encouraged, the use of animal flesh as food. Nanak has exposed this Ahinsa superstition in Asa Ki War (G.G.S. pg 472) and Malar Ke War (G.G.S. pg. 1288)''</ref> etc.) are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs.<ref>[http://www.sikhwomen.com/Community/Volunteer/langar.htm "Langar,"] at [http://www.sikhwomen.com/ http://www.sikhwomen.com]</ref>

Passages from the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the Adi Granth) say that fools argue over this issue.

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jain vegetarianism}}
Vegetarianism in [[Jainism]] is based on the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) like in Hinduism, but it is stricter than in the main Hindu traditions and mandatory for everyone. Jains are either [[Lacto-vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarians]] or [[Veganism|vegans]]. No use or consumption of products obtained from dead animals is allowed. Moreover Jains try to avoid unnecessary injury to plants and ''suksma jiva'' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] for ''subtle life forms''; minuscule organisms). The goal is to cause as little violence to living things as possible, hence they avoid eating roots, tubers and anything that involves uprooting (and thus eventually killing) a plant to obtain food.

==Abrahamic religions==
{{POV-section|date=December 2007}}
[[Judaic]], [[Christian]], and [[Muslim]] traditions ([[Abrahamic religion]]s) all have {{explain|strong connections to the biblical ideal of the [[Garden of Eden]]|very vague--"connections"?}}, which includes references to a diet similar to [[fruitarianism]] (see [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:29, 9:2-4; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 11:6-9). However, only minorities within these populations actually practice and advocate such strict diets, since the same book of the [[Bible]], Genesis, later gives permission to [[Noah]] (and presumably his descendants) to consume animal flesh due to an emergency lack of food situation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Judaism===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ebionites]] -->
[[Rabbi]]nical [[Judaism]] discourages [[ascetic]] practices in general, and encourages one to enjoy the bounty of this world in a proper fashion. With respect to food, this teaching may be summarized by the [[Talmud]]ic statement, "Man will have to account for everything he saw but did not eat." (This refers to permissible or [[Kashrut|kosher]] foods only, not to forbidden animal species such as [[pork]].) On the other hand, the Talmud discourages indulgence and states that it is preferable that one's diet consist mostly of non-meat products.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} To Jewish vegetarians wishing to remain consistent with this teaching, vegetarianism is not a form of self-deprivation, because the vegetarian does not desire to eat meat and believes it is healthier not to eat meat.

Several passages in the Old Testament encourages eating animal flesh such as Genesis 9:3 which states "Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you." 

Genesis 1:29 states "And God said: Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree that has seed-yielding fruit - to you it shall be for food." According to some classical [[meforshim|Jewish Bible commentators]] this means that God's original plan was for mankind to be vegetarian, and that God only later gave permission for man to eat meat because of man's weak nature.<ref name="Schwartz, Richard H 2001. p.1, 12">Schwartz, Richard H. Judaism and Vegetarianism. Lantern Books. New York, 2001. p.1, 12, 16, 19, 188. ISBN 1-930051-24-7.</ref>· As the ideal images of the Torah are vegetarian, it is natural to similarly see the laws of kashrut as actually designed to wean us away from meat eating towards the vegetarian ideal.<ref name="Kalechofsky, Roberta 1995. p.16, 54">Kalechofsky, Roberta. Rabbis and Vegetarianism: An Evolving Tradition. Micah Publications. Massachusetts, 1995. p.16, 54, 55, 65, 66, 68, 70, 71. ISBN 916288-42-0.</ref> The rituals of kashrut remind us of the magnitude of what we do each time we kill a living being.<ref name="Kalechofsky, Roberta 1995. p.16, 54"/> Other commentators argue that people may eat animals because God gave [[Adam and Eve]] dominion over them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Generally speaking, Judaism has not promoted vegetarianism. However, some prominent rabbis have promoted vegetarian lifestyle, among them [[David Cohen (rabbi)|David Cohen]] (known as "Ha-Nazir"), and Chief Rabbi of Israel [[Shlomo Goren]]. Rabbi Isaac ha-Levi Herzog said:{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

:"Jews will move increasingly to vegetarianism out of their own deepening knowledge of what their tradition commands... A whole galaxy of central rabbinic and spiritual leaders...has been affirming vegetarianism as the ultimate meaning of Jewish moral teaching."

:"Man ideally should not eat meat, for to eat meat a life must be taken, an animal must be put to death."

Rabbi Milgrom regards the commandment against blood as a law that permits man to "indulge in his lust for meat and not be brutalized in the process."{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Some Orthodox authorities have ruled that it is forbidden for an individual to become a vegetarian if they do so because they believe in animal rights;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} <!-- It seems that something like that (but not so strict) including the rabbi names is mentioned here: http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/vegetarianism-and-judaism.htm I'm not changing the text, because i'm not sure about my english --> however, they have ruled that vegetarianism is allowed for pragmatic reasons (if kosher meat is expensive or hard to come by in their area), health concerns, or for reasons of personal taste (if someone finds meat unpalatable). Some believe that [[halakha]] encourages the eating of meat at the Sabbath and Festival meals, thus some Orthodox Jews who are otherwise vegetarian will nevertheless consume meat at these meals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

There are several arguments from Judaism used by Jewish vegetarians.
For the Jewish vegetarian there are three main components which prove vegetarianism to be an ethical mitzvah: tsar baalei haim, pikuah nefesh and bal tashchit. Tsaar Baalei Haim is the injunction not to cause ‘pain to living creatures’. Pikkuah Nefesh is not only the regard for human life which is in immediate danger. Bal Tashchit is the law which prohibits waste.<ref name="Kalechofsky, Roberta 1995. p.16, 54"/> Another argument is that, since Adam and Eve were not allowed to eat meat and that, according to some opinions, in the [[Jewish Messiah|Messianic]] era, the whole world will be vegetarian, not eating meat is something that brings the world closer to that ideal. In his booklet summarizing many of Rav Kook’s teachings, Joseph Green, a 20th-century South African Jewish vegetarian writer, concludes that Jewish religious ethical vegetarians are pioneers of the messianic era; they are leading lives that make the coming of the Messiah more likely. The Jewish tradition asserts that one way to speed the coming of the Messiah is to start practicing the ways that will prevail in the messianic time.<ref name="Schwartz, Richard H 2001. p.1, 12"/>  A second one is that the laws of [[shechita]] are meant to prevent the suffering of animals and today, with [[factory farming]] and high-speed, mechanized [[slaughterhouse]]s, even kosher slaughterhouses are considered by some authorities not to fulfill enough of the requirements to render the meat kosher. A third one is that the Sages only mandated eating an olive's bulk of meat during festivals, but even then, this was because in Talmudic times, meat was considered essential for one's diet (whereas a vegetarian will probably be of the opinion that current science has shown otherwise).{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Sacrifices were used as an excuse to eat meat, and later denounced.
:* [[Hosea]] 8:13
::'''''They offer sacrifices to me because they are those who eat the meat''', but Hashem does not accept their sacrifices, for He is mindful of their sin and remembers their wickedness''

:* Hosea 6:6
::''For I desired mercy, '''and not sacrifice'''; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.''

:*[[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 7:22-23
::'''22''' ''For when I brought your forefathers out of Egypt and spoke to them, '''I did not give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices''','' '''23''' ''but I gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Walk in all the ways I command you, that it may go well with you.''

:*Isaiah 66:3
::''But '''whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a man''', and '''whoever offers a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck''' and '''whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pig's blood''', and whoever burns memorial incense, like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways, and their souls delight in their abominations;''

In Israel there is one vegetarian [[moshav]] (village), called [[Amirim]]. Its vegetarianism is based on general principles of health and ethics and not on the Jewish religion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian vegetarianism}}
{{refimprove|date=July 2009}}
Several Christian [[monasticism|monastic]] groups, including the [[Desert Fathers]], [[Trappist]]s, [[Benedictine]]s and [[Carthusian]]s, and also [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esoteric]] groups, such as the [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]],<ref>Article ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/magen503.htm The Wisdom of the Vegetarian Diet]'' by The [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]] ([[Esoteric Christian]]s)</ref><ref>[[Max Heindel]] (1910s), ''New Age Vegetarian Cookbook'', The Rosicrucian Fellowship (publisher), 492 pages</ref> have encouraged vegetarianism. Some [[Christian]] groups, such as [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]], take a literal interpretation of the Biblical prophecies of universal vegetarianism and encourage vegetarianism as a preferred, though not required, lifestyle. However, most evangelical groups are unaware of the existence of any such prophecies, and point instead to the explicit prophecies of temple sacrifices in the Messianic Kingdom, e.g. {{bibleref|Ezekiel|46:12|NIV}} where peace offerings and freewill offerings will be offered, and {{bibleref|Leviticus|7:15-20|NIV}} where it states that such offerings are eaten. Some Christian vegetarians{{whom|date=July 2009}} argue that Jesus himself was a vegetarian. There is one argument{{by whom|date=July 2009}} that Jesus was an [[Essene]] (vegetarian inhabitants of the Dead Sea community at Qumran). The present academic consensus is that Jesus was not an Essene<ref>Young, Richard Alan. Is God a Vegetarian?. Carus Publishing Company. Chicago, 1999. p.4, 7, 56, 117. ISBN 0-8126-9393-0.</ref>. There is no historical record of Jesus’ precise attitudes to animals, but there is a strand in his ethical teaching about the primacy of mercy to the weak, the powerless and the oppressed, which  Walters and Portmess argue can also refer to captive animals<ref name="Walters, Kerry S 2001. p.41, 42"/>. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and [[Saint David]] became vegetarians for [[ascetic]] reasons, not necessarily because of a religious edict to that effect{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. In the 19th century, members of the [[Bible Christian]] sect established the first vegetarian groups in England and the United States.

In the [[Book of Genesis]] by the Garden of Eden, there is no description of suffering, exploitation, or violence at all. People and animals may have been vegetarians, since {{bibleref|Genesis|1:29|KJV}} reads: “God said, ‘See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the Earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food’”. Immediately after the world in this state, God describes it as “very good.” This is the only time in the narrative that God calls creation “very good” instead of merely “good” – and this immediately follows God’s command with regard to vegetarianism.<ref>Dear, Fr. John. ''Christianity and Vegetarianism: Pursuing the Nonviolence of Jesus''. 2003. p. 4,6,16.</ref>

However, it has been argued{{by whom|date=July 2009}} that the [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] viewpoint of the Bible encourages human exploitation of animals and meat eating. {{bibleref|Genesis|1:26-28|KJV}} has been interpreted{{by whom|date=July 2009}} to condemn vegetarianism. The Bible says: "..And God said, Let us make man in our image, and after our likeness: and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the [[fowl]] of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."  In addition, {{bibleref|Genesis|1:28|KJV}} states "God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.".  In {{bibleref|Genesis|1:30|KJV}}: "And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so." Continuing into {{bibleref|Genesis|1:31|KJV}}, the Bible says: "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."

In {{bibleref|Romans|14:2|KJV}} St. Paul may explicitly discourage vegetarianism, since he writes "For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs." 

Non-vegetarian Christians{{whom|date=July 2009}} sometimes cite {{bibleref|Numbers|11:31-32|KJV}}: “And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth. And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.” But the next verse says, “And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.”

On a more practical level, [[Eastern Christianity]] generally recommends veganism as part of [[fasting]] during the [[Great Lent]]; vegan fasting is particularly common in the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], such as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], which generally [[fasting and abstinence of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|fasts 210 days out of the year]].

===Islam===
{{See also|Islam and animals}}
[[Islam]] explicitly prohibits eating of some kinds of meat, especially pork. However, one of the most important Islamic celebrations, ''Eid ul-Adha'', involves animal sacrifices. Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice their best domestic animals (usually sheep, but also camels, cows, and goats). According to the Quran {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} a large portion of the meat has to be given towards the poor and hungry people so they can all join in the feast on Eid-ul-Adha. The remainder is cooked for the family celebration meal in which relatives and friends are invited to share. The regular charitable practices of the Muslim community are demonstrated during Eid ul-Adha by the concerted effort to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during these days. Since these practices are justified by Koran, advocacy of vegetarianism by implying that God ordained diet to be immoral could be seen as contrary to Islam.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Certain Islamic orders are mainly vegetarian; many [[Sufism|Sufis]] maintain a vegetarian diet,<ref>{{cite web

===Rastafari===
[[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]] generally follow a diet called "[[I-tal]]", which eschews the eating of food that has been artificially preserved, flavoured, or chemically altered in any way. Many Rastafarians consider it to also forbid the eating of meat.   

===Bahá'í Faith===
While there are no dietary restrictions in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick.<ref name="PSmith">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Diet |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |id= ISBN 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 121-122}}</ref>  He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society would gradually become vegetarian.<ref name="PSmith"/><ref>{{cite book |author = Esslemont, J.E. |authorlink = John Esslemont |year = 1980 |title = Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era |edition = 5th |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0877431604

==Other religions==
===Taoism===
In Chinese societies, "simple eating" (素食 [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]]: sù shí) refers to a particular restricted diet associated with [[Taoism|Taoist]] monks, and sometimes practiced by members of the general population during Taoist festivals. It is referred to by the English word "vegetarian"; however, though it rejects meat, eggs, and milk, this diet does include oysters and oyster products.

===Zoroastrianism===
One of the main precepts in [[Zoroastrianism]] is respect and kindness towards all living things, condemnation of cruelty against animals and the [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice of animals]].

===Neopaganism===
There is no set teaching on vegetarianism within the diverse [[neopagan]] communities, however many do follow a vegetarian diet often connected to [[ecological]] concerns as well as the welfare and rights of animals. Vegetarian practitioners of [[Wicca]] will often see their standpoint as a natural extension of the [[Wiccan Rede]] and [[Odinist]]s of [[Odinism]].  Organisations like SERV refer to the historic figures of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Iamblichus]] as sources for the Pagan view of vegetarianism. [http://www.serv-online.org/Pagan-quotations.htm] During the 1970s the publication [[Earth Religion News]], focused on articles related to neopaganism and vegetarianism, it was edited by the author [[Herman Slater]].
