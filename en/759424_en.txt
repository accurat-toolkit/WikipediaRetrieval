'''Chyngyz Aitmatov''' ({{lang-ky|Чыңгыз Айтматов}}, {{IPA2|tʃɯŋˈʀɯs ɑjtˈmɑtəf}}; {{lang-ru|Чингиз Торекулович Айтматов}}) ([[12 December]] [[1928]], [[Sheker]], [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz ASSR]] - [[10 June]] [[2008]], [[Nuremberg]], Germany<ref name=reuters>"[http://uk.reuters.com/article/stageNews/idUKL1059845020080612 Kyrgyz writer, perestroika ally Aitmatov dies]," Reuters UK, 10 June 2008</ref>) was an author who wrote in both Russian and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]]. He was the best known figure in [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s literature.

== Life ==

Aitmatov's parents were civil servants in [[Sheker]]. The name Chingiz is the same as the honorary title of [[Genghis Khan]]. In early childhood he wandered as a [[nomad]] with his family, as the [[Kyrgyzstan]] people did at the time. In 1937 his father was charged with "[[bourgeois nationalism]]" in Moscow, arrested and executed in 1938.<ref name=reuters/>

Aitmatov lived at a time when Kyrgyzstan was being transformed from one of the most remote lands of the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] to a republic of the [[USSR]]. The future author studied at a Soviet school in Sheker. He also worked from an early age. At fourteen he was an assistant to the Secretary at the Village [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]. He later held jobs as a tax collector, a loader, an engineer's assistant and continued with many other types of work.

In 1946 he began studying at the [[Animal Husbandry]] Division of the Kirghiz Agricultural Institute in [[Bishkek|Frunze]], but later switched to literary studies at the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]] in Moscow, where he lived from 1956 to 1958. For the next eight years he worked for [[Pravda]]. His first two publications appeared in 1952 in Russian: "The Newspaper Boy Dziuio" and "Ашым." His first work published in Kyrgyz was "Ак Жаан" (White rain, 1954), and his well-known work "[[Jamilya]]" (Jamila) appeared in 1958. 1980 saw his first novel ''The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years''; his next significant novel, ''The Scaffold'' was published in 1988. ''The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years'' and other writings were translated into several languages.

Aitmatov suffered [[kidney failure]] and on 16 May 2008 was admitted to a hospital in Nuremberg, Germany, where he died of [[pneumonia]] on 10 June 2008, aged 79.<ref name=reuters/>  After his death, he was flown to Kyrgyzstan, where there were numerous ceremonies before he was buried in Ata Beyit cemetery, which he helped found<ref name="eurasianet">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/pp061108.shtml |title="KYRGYZSTAN: CHINGIZ AITMATOV, A MODERN HERO, DIES" |publisher=EurasiaNet |date=2008-06-11 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref> and where his father most likely is buried,<ref name="rferldeath">{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Chyngyz_Aitmatovs_Lifelong_Journey_Toward_Eternity/1359041.html |title=Chingiz Aitmatov's Lifelong Journey Toward Eternity |publisher=Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty |date=2008-12-12 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref> in Chong-Tash village, [[Alamüdün district]], [[Chüy oblast]], Kyrgyzstan.

His obituary in [[The New York Times]] characterized him as "a Communist writer whose novels and plays before the collapse of the Soviet Union gave a voice to the people of the remote Soviet republic of Kyrgyz" and adds that he "later became a diplomat and a friend and adviser to the Soviet leader [[Mikhail S. Gorbachev]]."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/books/15aitmatov.html?ref=obituaries Chingiz Aitmatov, Who Wrote of Life in U.S.S.R., Is Dead at 79] by Bruce Weber in The New York Times, 15 June 2008</ref>

Chinghiz Aitmatov belonged to the post-war generation of writers. His output before "Jamila"
<ref name="jami">Chingiz Aitmatov. [http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Stories/Jamila.html Jamila]. Translated by Fainna Glagoleva. Prepared for the Internet by Iraj Bashiri, 2002.</ref> was not significant, a few short stories and a short novel called ''Face to Face''. But it was "Jamila" that came to prove the author's work.<ref name="jami"/> [[Louis Aragon]] described the novelette as the world's most beautiful love story, raising it even above [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''World's Most Beautiful Love Story''. Aitmatov's representative works also include the short novels ''Farewell, Gulsary!'',<ref name="gu">Chingiz Aitmatov. [http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Stories/Gyulsary.html FAREWELL, GYULSARY!] Translation into English by Progress Publishers, © 1973 {{en}}</ref> ''The White Ship'', ''[[The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years]]'',<ref name="the day">[http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop/weblog/archives/000099.html The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years by Chingiz Aitmatov], book preview</ref> and ''The Scaffold''.

Aitmatov was honoured in 1963 with the [[Lenin Prize]] for "Jamila" and was later awarded a State prize for ''Farewell, Gulsary!''.<ref name="gu"/> Aitmatov's art was glorified by admirers.<ref>Iraj Bashiri. ''[http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Aitmatov/Jamila.html The Art of Chingiz Aitmatov's Stories]''{{en}} (discussion of Aitmatov's characters)</ref> Even critics of Aitmatov mentioned the high quality of his novels.<ref>[[Sofia Kallistratova|S.V.Kallistratova]].

Aitmatov's work has some elements that are unique specifically to his creative process. His work drew on folklore, not in the ancient sense of it; rather, he tried to recreate and synthesize oral tales in the context of contemporary life. This is prevalent in his work; in nearly every story he refers to a myth, a legend, or a folktale.<ref name=reuters/> In ''The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years,'' a poetic legend about a young captive turned into a [[mankurt]] serves as a tragic allegory and becomes a significant symbolic expression of the philosophy of the novel.

A second aspect of Aitmatov's writing is his ultimate closeness to our "little brothers" the animals, for their and our lives are intimately and inseparably connected. The two center characters of ''Farewell, Gulsary!'' are a man and his stallion. A camel plays a prominent role in ''The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years''; one of the key turns of the novel which decides the fate of the main character is narrated through the story of the camel's rut and riot. ''The Scaffold'' starts off and finishes with the story of a wolf pack and the great wolf-mother Akbara and her cub; human lives enter the narrative but interweave with the lives of the wolves.

== Political career ==

In addition to his literary work, Chinghiz Aitmatov was the Kyrgyzstan ambassador to the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], [[UNESCO]] and the [[Benelux]] countries.<ref name=reuters/> He was also the father of former Kyrgyzstan foreign minister, [[Askar Aitmatov]].
