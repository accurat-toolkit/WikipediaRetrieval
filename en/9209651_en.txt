'''Communism''' is a [[socioeconomic]] structure and [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]] that promotes the establishment of an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]], [[classlessness|classless]], [[stateless society]] based on [[common ownership]] and control of the [[means of production]] and property in general.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morris |first=William |authorlink=William Morris |title=News from nowhere |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1890/nowhere/index.htm |accessdate=January 2008}}</ref><ref name="columbia"/><ref name="encarta">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Colton |first=Timothy J. |title=Communism |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html |encyclopedia=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia |year=2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwRDfaqs|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] posited that communism would be the final stage in [[society|human society]], which would be achieved through a [[proletarian revolution]]. "Pure communism" in the Marxian sense refers to a classless, stateless and oppression-free society where decisions on what to produce and what policies to pursue are made [[direct democracy|democratically]], allowing every member of society to participate in the [[decision making|decision-making process]] in both the political and economic spheres of life. 

As a political ideology, communism is usually considered to be a branch of [[socialism]]; a broad group of economic and [[political philosophy|political philosophies]] that draw on the various political and intellectual movements with origins in the work of
theorists of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].<ref>"Socialism." Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia. [[Columbia University Press]]. 03 Feb. 2008.<reference.com http://www.reference.com/browse/columbia/socialis>.</ref> Communism attempts to offer an alternative to the [[Critique of capitalism|problems]] with the [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[market economy]] and the legacy of [[imperialism]] and [[nationalism]]. Marx states that the only way to solve these problems is for the working class (proletariat), who according to Marx are the main producers of wealth in society and are exploited by the Capitalist-class ([[bourgeoisie]]), to replace the bourgeoisie as the ruling class in order to establish a [[free society]], without class or racial divisions.<ref name="columbia"/> The dominant forms of communism, such as [[Leninism]], [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]] and [[Trotskyism]] are based on [[Marxism]], but non-Marxist versions of communism (such as [[Christian communism]] and [[anarcho-communism]]) also exist.

Karl Marx never provided a detailed description as to how communism would function as an economic system, but it is understood that a communist economy would consist of common ownership of the means of production, culminating in the negation of the concept of [[private ownership]] of capital, which referred to the means of production in Marxian terminology. 

In modern usage, communism is often used to refer to [[Bolshevism]] or [[Marxism-Leninism]] and the policies of the various [[communist states]] who had government ownership of all the means of production and [[Planned economy|centrally planned economies]]. Communist regimes have historically been authoritarian, repressive, and coercive governments concerned primarily with preserving their own power.<ref name="encarta"/>

==Terminology==
{{Split section| List of communist ideologies|date=October 2009}}
In the schema of [[historical materialism]], communism is the idea of a free society with no division or alienation, where mankind is free from oppression and scarcity. A communist society would have no governments, countries, or class divisions. In [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]], the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] is the intermediate system between capitalism and communism, when the government is in the process of changing the means of ownership from [[privatism]], to collective ownership.<ref> {{cite web |title=Critique of the Gotha Programme--IV |work=Critique of the Gotha Programme |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch04.htm |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> 
In [[political science]], the term "communism" is sometimes used to refer to [[communist state]]s, a [[form of government]] in which the [[Sovereign state|state]] operates under a [[single-party state|one-party system]] and declares allegiance to [[Marxism-Leninism]] or a derivative thereof.

Self-identified communists hold a variety of views, including [[Marxism-Leninism]], [[Trotskyism]], [[council communism]], [[Luxemburgism]], [[anarchist communism]], [[Christian communism]], and various currents of [[left communism]].

===Marxism===
[[File:communist-manifesto.png|thumb|left|[[The Communist Manifesto]].]]

{{Main|Marxism}}

Like other socialists, Marx and Engels sought an end to capitalism and the systems which they perceived to be responsible for the exploitation of workers. But whereas earlier socialists often favored longer-term [[Reform movement|social reform]], Marx and Engels believed that popular revolution was all but inevitable, and the only path to the socialist state.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Colton |first=Timothy J. |title=Communism |url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761572241___0/Communism.html |encyclopedia=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia |year=2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwREEzvq|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

According to the Marxist argument for communism, the main characteristic of human life in [[Social class|class society]] is [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]; and communism is desirable because it entails the full realization of [[Human Freedom|human freedom]].<ref>Stephen Whitefield. "Communism." ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics''. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. [[Oxford University Press]], 2003.</ref> Marx here follows [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in conceiving freedom not merely as an absence of restraints but as action with content.<ref name="mclean">McLean and McMillan, 2003.</ref> According to Marx, Communism's outlook on freedom was based on an agent, obstacle, and goal. The agent is the common/working people; the obstacles are class divisions, economic inequalities, unequal [[Life chances|life-chances]], and [[false consciousness]]; and the goal is the fulfillment of human needs including satisfying work, and fair share of the product.<ref>Ball and Dagger 118</ref><ref>Terence Ball and Richard Dagger. "Political Ideologies and the Democratic Ideal." [[Pearson Education]], Inc.:2006.</ref> They believed that communism allowed people to do what they want, but also put humans in such conditions and such relations with one another that they would not wish to exploit, or have any need to. Whereas for Hegel the unfolding of this ethical life in history is mainly driven by the realm of ideas, for Marx, communism emerged from material forces, particularly the development of the [[means of production]].<ref name = "mclean"/>

Marxism holds that a process of [[class conflict]] and revolutionary struggle will result in victory for the [[proletariat]] and the establishment of a [[communist society]] in which private ownership is abolished over time and the means of production and subsistence belong to the community. Marx himself wrote little about life under communism, giving only the most general indication as to what constituted a communist society. It is clear that it entails abundance in which there is little limit to the projects that humans may undertake.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In the popular slogan that was adopted by the [[Communist Movement|communist movement]], communism was a world in which each gave according to their abilities, and received according to their needs. ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1845) was one of Marx's few writings to elaborate on the communist future:

<blockquote>"In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic."<ref>Karl Marx, (1845). ''[[The German Ideology]]'', Marx-Engels Institute, Moscow. ISBN 978-1-57392-258-6. Sources available at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm The German Ideology<!--Bot-generated title-->] at www.marxists.org.</ref>
</blockquote>

Marx's lasting vision was to add this vision to a theory of how society was moving in a law-governed way toward communism, and, with some tension, a political theory that explained why revolutionary activity was required to bring it about.<ref name="mclean"/>

In the late 19th century, the terms "socialism" and "communism" were often used interchangeably. However, Marx and Engels argued that communism would not emerge from capitalism in a fully [[Developed country|developed state]], but would pass through a "first phase" in which most productive property was owned in common, but with some class differences remaining. The "first phase" would eventually evolve into a "higher phase" in which class differences were eliminated, and a state was no longer needed. Lenin frequently used the term "socialism" to refer to Marx and Engels' supposed "first phase" of communism and used the term "communism" interchangeably with Marx and Engels' "higher phase" of communism.<ref name="encarta"/>

These later aspects, particularly as developed by Lenin, provided the underpinning for the mobilizing features of 20th century Communist parties. Later writers such as [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Nicos Poulantzas]] modified Marx's vision by allotting a central place to the state in the development of such societies, by arguing for a prolonged transition period of socialism prior to the attainment of full communism.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Marxism-Leninism===
{{Main|Marxism-Leninism}}

Marxism-Leninism is a version of socialism adopted by the Soviet Union and most Communist Parties across the world today. It shaped the Soviet Union and influenced Communist Parties worldwide. It was heralded as a possibility of building communism via a massive program of [[industrialization]] and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]]. Historically, under the ideology of Marxism-Leninism the rapid development of industry, and above all the victory of the Soviet Union in the Second World War occurred alongside a third of the world being lead by Marxist-Leninist inspired parties. Despite the fall of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries, many communist Parties of the world today still lay claim to uphold the Marxist-Leninist banner. Marxism-Leninism expands on Marxists thoughts by bringing the theories to what Lenin and other Communists considered, the age of capitalist imperialism, and a renewed focus on party building, the development of a [[socialist state]], and democratic centralism as an organizational principle.

===Stalinism===
{{Main|Stalinism}}
"Stalinism" refers to the [[political system]] of the [[Soviet Union]], and the countries within the Soviet [[sphere of influence]], during the leadership of Joseph Stalin. The term usually defines the style of a government rather than an ideology. The ideology was "[[Marxism-Leninism]] theory", reflecting that Stalin himself was not a theoretician, in contrast to [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and prided himself on maintaining the legacy of Lenin as a founding father for the Soviet Union and the future Socialist world. Stalinism is an interpretation of their ideas, and a certain political regime claiming to apply those ideas in ways fitting the changing needs of society, as with the transition from "socialism at a snail's pace" in the mid-twenties to the rapid industrialization of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]]s.

The main contributions of Stalin to communist theory were:
* The groundwork for the Soviet policy concerning nationalities, laid in Stalin's 1913 work ''Marxism and the National Question'',<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03.htm "Marxism and the National Question"]</ref> praised by Lenin.
* [[Socialism in One Country]],
* The theory of [[aggravation of class struggle under socialism|aggravation of the class struggle along with the development of socialism]], a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary.

===Trotskyism===
[[File:Trotsky militant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|right|[[Leon Trotsky]] reading ''[[The Militant]]''.]]
{{Main|Trotskyism}}

Trotsky and his supporters organized into the ''[[Left Opposition]]'' and their platform became known as ''[[Trotskyism]]''. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. During Trotsky's exile, world communism fractured into two distinct branches: [[Marxism-Leninism]] and [[Trotskyism]].<ref name="columbia"/> Trotsky later founded the [[Fourth International]], a Trotskyist rival to the [[Comintern]], in 1938.

Trotskyist ideas have continually found a modest echo among [[political movement]]s in some countries in [[Latin America]] and [[Asia]], especially in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Many Trotskyist organizations are also active in more stable, developed countries in [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]]. Trotsky's politics differed sharply from those of Stalin and Mao, most importantly in declaring the need for an international proletarian revolution (rather than socialism in one country) and unwavering support for a true dictatorship of the proletariat based on democratic principles.

However, as a whole, Trotsky's theories and attitudes were never accepted in worldwide mainstream Communist circles after Trotsky's expulsion, either within or outside of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]]. This remained the case even after the [[Secret Speech]] and subsequent events critics claim exposed the fallibility of [[Stalin]].

Some criticize Trotskyism as incapable of using concrete analysis on its theories, rather resorting to phrases and abstract notions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marx2mao.com/Other/OT73NB.html |title=On Trotskyism |publisher=Marx2mao.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.flash.net/~comvoice/32cTrotskyism.html |title=Swedish FRP on anti-Marxist-Leninist dogmas of Trotskyism |publisher=Home.flash.net |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080201115440/http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/wim/wyl/ |title=What's Your Line? |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

===Maoism===
[[File:5PadriComunisti.svg|thumb|right|200px|This poster shows Mao Zedong as continuing the legacy set by former Communist leaders.<ref>This poster has been jokingly referred to as "The History of Shaving" [http://www.iisg.nl/~landsberger/if.html Stefan Landsberger's Chinese Propaganda Poster Pages-Ideological Foundations]</ref>]]
{{Main|Maoism}}

Maoism is the Marxist-Leninist trend of Communism associated with [[Mao Zedong]] and was mostly practiced within the [[People's Republic of China]]. Khrushchev's reforms heightened ideological differences between the [[People's Republic of China]] and the Soviet Union, which became increasingly apparent in the 1960s. As the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] in the [[History of communism|international Communist movement]] turned toward open hostility, China portrayed itself as a leader of the underdeveloped world against the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Parties and groups that supported the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) in their criticism against the new Soviet leadership proclaimed themselves as 'anti-revisionist' and denounced the CPSU and the parties aligned with it as [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] "capitalist-roaders." The Sino-Soviet Split resulted in divisions amongst communist parties around the world. Notably, the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] sided with the People's Republic of China. Effectively, the CPC under Mao's leadership became the rallying forces of a parallel international Communist tendency. The ideology of CPC, Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought (generally referred to as 'Maoism'), was adopted by many of these groups.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

After Mao's death and his replacement by [[Deng Xiaoping]], the international Maoist movement diverged. One sector accepted the new leadership in China; a second renounced the new leadership and reaffirmed their commitment to Mao's legacy; and a third renounced Maoism altogether and aligned with [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Hoxhaism===
Another variant of [[anti-revisionist]] [[Marxism-Leninism]] appeared after the [[Sino-Albanian split|ideological row]] between the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] in 1978. The Albanians rallied a new separate international tendency. This tendency would demarcate itself by a strict defense of the legacy of Joseph Stalin and fierce criticism of virtually all other Communist groupings as [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]]. Critical of the United States, Soviet Union, and China, [[Enver Hoxha]] declared the latter two to be [[social-imperialist]] and condemned the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] by withdrawing from the [[Warsaw Pact]] in response. Hoxha declared Albania to be the world's only Marxist-Leninist state after 1978. The Albanians were able to win over a large share of the Maoists, mainly in [[Latin America]] such as the [[Popular Liberation Army]], but also had a significant [[Party of Labour of Albania#External following|international following]] in general. This tendency has occasionally been labeled as 'Hoxhaism' after him.

After the fall of the Communist government in Albania, the pro-Albanian parties are grouped around an [[International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations (Unity & Struggle)|international conference]] and the publication 'Unity and Struggle'.

===Titoism===
{{Main|Titoism}}
Elements of Titoism are characterized by policies and practices based on the principle that in each country, the means of attaining ultimate communist goals must be dictated by the conditions of that particular country, rather than by a pattern set in another country. During Tito’s era, this specifically meant that the communist goal should be pursued independently of (and often in opposition to) the policies of the [[Soviet Union]].

The term was originally meant as a [[pejorative]], and was labeled by Moscow as a heresy during the period of tensions between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia known as the ''[[Informbiro]]'' period from 1948 to 1955.

Unlike the rest of [[Eastern Bloc|East Europe]], which fell under [[Stalin]]'s influence post-World War II, [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], due to the strong leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] and the fact that the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] liberated Yugoslavia with only limited help from the [[Red Army]], remained independent from Moscow. It became the only country in the [[Balkans]] to resist pressure from Moscow to join the [[Warsaw Pact]] and remained "socialist, but independent" right up until the collapse of Soviet socialism in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Throughout his time in office, Tito prided himself on Yugoslavia's independence from Russia, with Yugoslavia never accepting full membership of the [[Comecon]] and Tito's open rejection of many aspects of [[Stalinism]] as the most obvious manifestations of this.

===Eurocommunism===
{{Main|Eurocommunism}}
Since the early 1970s, the term [[Eurocommunism]] was used to refer to moderate, reformist Communist parties in western Europe. These parties did not support the Soviet Union and denounced its policies. Such parties were politically active and electorally significant in [[Italy]] ([[Italian Communist Party|PCI]]), [[France]] ([[French Communist Party|PCF]]), and [[Spain]] ([[Communist Party of Spain|PCE]]).<ref name="encarta"/>

===Council communism===
{{Main|Council communism}}
Council communism is a [[far-left]] movement originating in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both left-wing [[Marxism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].

The central argument of council communism, in contrast to those of [[social democracy]] and [[Leninism|Leninist]] Communism, is that democratic [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organisation and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the [[reformist]] and the Leninist [[ideology|ideologies]], with their stress on, respectively, [[parliament]]s and [[New institutionalism|institutional]] government (i.e., by applying social reforms), on the one hand, and [[vanguard party|vanguard parties]] and participative [[democratic centralism]] on the other).

The core principle of council communism is that the [[government]] and the [[economic system|economy]] should be managed by [[workers' councils]] composed of [[delegate]]s elected at workplaces and [[recall election|recallable]] at any moment. As such, council communists oppose [[planned economy|state-run]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] "[[State socialism]]"/"[[State capitalism]]". They also oppose the idea of a "revolutionary party", since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a worker's democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils. Council communism (and other types of "[[antiauthoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] and [[Anti-Leninism|Anti-leninist]] Marxism" such as [[Autonomism]]) are often viewed as being similar to [[Anarchism]] because they criticize Leninist ideologies for being authoritarian and reject the idea of a vanguard party.

===Juche===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}
{{Main|Juche}}
In 1992, [[Juche]] replaced [[Marxism-Leninism]] in the revised North Korean constitution as the official state ideology, this being a response to the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Juche was originally defined as a creative application of Marxism-Leninism, but after the 1991 collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] (North Korea’s greatest economic benefactor), all reference to Marxism-Leninism was dropped in the revised 1998 constitution. The establishment of the [[Songun]] doctrine in the mid-1990s has formally designated the [[military]], not the [[proletariat]] or [[working class]], as the main revolutionary force in North Korea. All reference to communism had been dropped in the 2009 revised constitution.<ref>http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSEO253213</ref>

According to Kim Jong-il's ''On the Juche Idea'', the application of Juche in state policy entails the following:
# The people must have independence (''chajusong'') in thought and [[politics]], economic [[self-sufficiency]], and self-reliance in defense.
# Policy must reflect the will and aspirations of the masses and employ them fully in revolution and construction.
# Methods of revolution and construction must be suitable to the situation of the country.
# The most important work of revolution and construction is molding people ideologically as communists and mobilizing them to constructive action.

===Prachandapath===
[[File:Prachanda.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prachanda]], giving a speech at the Nepalese city of [[Pokhara]].]]
{{Main|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)}}
Prachanda Path refers to the ideological line of the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]]. This thought doesn't make an ideological break with [[Marxism]],[[Leninism]] and [[Maoism]] but it is an extension of these ideologies totally based on home-ground politics of [[Nepal]]. The doctrine came into existence after it was realized that the ideology of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism couldn't be practiced completely as it were done in the past. And an ideology suitable, based on the ground reality of Nepalese politics was adopted by the party.

After five years of armed struggle, the party realized that none of the proletarian revolutions of the past could be carried out on Nepal’s context. So moving further ahead than Marxism, Leninism and Maoism, the party determined its own ideology, Prachanda Path.

Having analyzed the serious challenges and growing changes in the [[Global Arena|global arena]], the party started moving on its own doctrine. Prachanda Path in essence is a different kind of uprising, which can be described as the fusion of a protracted people’s war strategy which was adopted by [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] in China and the Russian model of armed revolution. Most of the Maoist leaders think that the adoption of Prachanda Path after the second national conference is what nudged the party into moving ahead with a clear vision ahead after five years of ‘people’s war’.

Senior Maoist leader Mohan Vaidya alias Kiran says, ‘Just as Marxism was born in Germany, Leninism in Russia and Maoism in China and Prachanda Path is Nepal’s identity of revolution. Just as Marxism has three facets- philosophy, [[political economy]] and scientific socialism, Prachanda Path is a combination of all three totally in Nepal’s political context.’ Talking about the party’s philosophy, Maoist chairman [[Prachanda]] says, ‘The party considers Prachanda path as an enrichment of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism.’ After the party brought forward its new doctrine, the government was trying to comprehend the new ideology, Prachanda Path.

==Non-Marxist schools==
The dominant forms of communism, such as [[Leninism]], [[Trotskyism]] and [[Maoism]], are based on [[Marxism]], but non-Marxist versions of communism (such as [[Christian communism]] and [[anarchist communism]]) also exist and are growing in importance since the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|fall of the Soviet Union]].

===Anarcho-communism===
{{Main|Anarcho-communism}}

Some of Marx's contemporaries espoused similar ideas, but differed in their views of how to reach to a classless society. Following the split between those associated with Marx and [[Mikhail Bakunin]] at the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]], the anarchists formed the [[International Workers Association]].<ref>Marshall, Peter. "Demanding the Impossible&nbsp; — A History of Anarchism" p. 9. Fontana Press, London, 1993 ISBN 978-0-00-686245-1</ref> Anarchists argued that capitalism and the state were inseparable and that one could not be abolished without the other. [[Anarchist communism|Anarchist-communists]] such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] theorized an immediate transition to one society with no classes. [[Anarcho-syndicalism]] became one of the dominant forms of [[List of anarchist organizations|anarchist organization]], arguing that [[Trade union|labor unions]], as opposed to Communist parties, are the organizations that can change society. Consequently, many anarchists have been in opposition to Marxist communism to this day.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Christian communism===
{{Main|Christian communism}}

Christian communism is a form of religious communism centered on Christianity. It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the [[Jesus|teachings of Jesus]] Christ urge Christians to support communism as the ideal [[Social structure|social system]]. Christian communists trace the origins of their practice to teachings in the [[New Testament]], such as this one from [[Acts of the Apostles]] at chapter 2 and verses 42, 44, and 45:
<blockquote>'''42''' ''And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and in fellowship [...]'' '''44''' ''And all that believed were together, and had all things in common;'' '''45''' ''And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.'' ([[Authorized King James Version|King James Version]])</blockquote>

Christian communism can be seen as a radical form of [[Christian socialism]]. Also, due to the fact that many Christian communists have formed independent stateless communes in the past, there is also a link between Christian communism and [[Christian anarchism]]. Christian communists may or may not agree with various parts of [[Marxism]].

Christian communists also share some of the political goals of Marxists, for example replacing capitalism with [[socialism]], which should in turn be followed by communism at a later point in the future. However, Christian communists sometimes disagree with Marxists (and particularly with [[Leninism|Leninists]]) on the way a socialist or communist society should be organized.

==History==
{{Main|History of communism}}

===Early communism===
{{See|Primitive communism|Religious communism}}

Karl Heinrich Marx saw [[primitive communism]] as the original, [[hunter-gatherer]] state of humankind from which it arose. For Marx, only after humanity was capable of producing [[Economic surplus|surplus]], did private property develop.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In the [[History of Western philosophy|history of Western thought]], certain elements of the idea of a society based on common ownership of property can be traced back to [[Ancient history|ancient times]] .<ref name="encarta"/> Examples include the [[Spartacus]] [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in Rome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/spartacus.html |title=Historical Background for Spartacus |publisher=Vroma.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> The [[5th century|fifth century]] [[Mazdak]] movement in what is now [[Iran]] has been described as "communistic" for challenging the enormous privileges of the noble classes and the clergy, criticizing the institution of private property and for striving for an egalitarian society.<ref>''The Cambridge History of Iran'' Volume 3, [http://web.archive.org/web/20080611075040/http://www.derafsh-kaviyani.com/english/mazdak.html The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Period], edited by [[Ehsan Yarshater]], Parts 1 and 2, p1019, [[Cambridge University Press]] (1983)</ref>

At one time or another, various small communist communities existed, generally under the inspiration of [[Scripture]].<ref name="britannica">"Communism." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2006. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online.</ref> In the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Christian Church|Christian church]], for example, some [[Monasticism|monastic]] communities and [[religious order]]s shared their land and other property (see [[religious communism]] and [[Christian communism]]). These groups often believed that concern with [[private property]] was a distraction from religious service to God and neighbor.<ref name="encarta"/>

Communist thought has also been traced back to the work of [[16th century]] English writer [[Thomas More]]. In his treatise ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), More portrayed a society based on [[common ownership]] of property, whose rulers administered it through the application of reason.<ref name="encarta"/> In the 17th century, communist thought arguably surfaced again in England.

===Growth of modern communism===
[[File:Soviet Union, Lenin (55).jpg|thumb|left|[[Vladimir Lenin]], following his return to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]].]]
{{Main|History of Communism}}

In the late 19th century, Russian Marxism developed a distinct character. The first major figure of Russian Marxism was [[Georgi Plekhanov]]. Underlying the work of Plekhanov was the assumption that Russia, less urbanized and industrialized than Western Europe, had many years to go before society would be ready for proletarian revolution to occur, and a transitional period of a bourgeois democratic regime would be required to replace [[Tsar]]ism with a socialist and later communist society.&nbsp;(EB){{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In Russia, the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] was the first time any party with an avowedly Marxist orientation, in this case the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]], seized [[Political power|state power]]. The assumption of state power by the Bolsheviks generated a great deal of practical and theoretical debate within the Marxist movement. Marx predicted that socialism and communism would be built upon foundations laid by the most advanced capitalist development. Russia, however, was one of the poorest countries in Europe with an enormous, largely illiterate [[peasantry]] and a minority of industrial workers. Marx had explicitly stated that Russia might be able to skip the stage of bourgeoisie capitalism.<ref>Marc Edelman, "Late Marx and the Russian road: Marx and the 'Peripheries of Capitalism'" - [[book review]]s. ''Monthly Review'', Dec., 1984. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_v36/ai_3537723 Late Marx and the Russian road: Marx and the "Peripheries of Capitalism." - book reviews Monthly Review Find Articles at BNET<!--Bot-generated title-->] at www.findarticles.com.</ref> Other socialists also believed that a [[October Revolution|Russian revolution]] could be the precursor of workers' revolutions in the West.

The moderate [[Menshevik]]s opposed Lenin's Bolshevik plan for [[Communist revolution|socialist revolution]] before capitalism was more fully developed. The Bolsheviks' successful rise to power was based upon the slogans "peace, bread, and land" and "All power to the Soviets", slogans which tapped the massive public desire for an end to Russian involvement in the [[World War I|First World War]], the peasants' demand for [[land reform]], and popular support for the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The usage of the terms "communism" and "socialism" shifted after 1917, when the Bolsheviks changed their name to the Communist Party and installed a [[single party state|single party]] regime devoted to the implementation of socialist policies under [[Leninism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The [[Second International]] had dissolved in 1916 over national divisions, as the separate national parties that composed it did not maintain a unified front against the [[World War I|war]], instead generally supporting their respective nation's role. Lenin thus created the [[Third International]] (Comintern) in 1919 and sent the [[Twenty-one Conditions]], which included [[democratic centralism]], to all European [[Democratic socialism|socialist parties]] willing to adhere. In France, for example, the majority of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) party split in 1921 to form the [[French Communist Party|French Section of the Communist International]] (SFIC).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Henceforth, the term "Communism" was applied to the objective of the parties founded under the umbrella of the Comintern. Their program called for the uniting of workers of the world for revolution, which would be followed by the establishment of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] as well as the development of a [[Socialist economics|socialist economy]]. Ultimately, if their program held, there would develop a harmonious classless society, with the [[withering away of the state]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[File:Communist countries.PNG|thumb|right|300px|A map of countries who declared themselves to be socialist states under the Marxist-Leninist or Maoist definition (in other words, "communist states") at some point in their history. The map uses present-day borders.]]
During the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918–1922), the Bolsheviks [[nationalization|nationalized]] all productive property and imposed a policy of ''[[war communism]]'', which put factories and railroads under strict government control, collected and rationed food, and introduced some bourgeois management of industry. After three years of war and the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]], Lenin declared the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) in 1921, which was to give a "limited place for a limited time to capitalism." The NEP lasted until 1928, when [[Joseph Stalin]] achieved party leadership, and the introduction of the first Five Year Plan spelled the end of it. Following the Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks formed in 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), or [[Soviet Union]], from the former [[Russian Empire]].

Following Lenin's democratic centralism, the Communist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis, with active cells of members as the broad base; they were made up only of elite [[cadre]]s approved by higher members of the party as being reliable and completely subject to [[party discipline]].<ref>[[Norman Davies]]. "Communism" ''The Oxford Companion to World War II''. Ed. I. C. B. Dear and [[M. R. D. Foot]]. Oxford University Press, 2001.</ref>

After [[World War II]], Communists consolidated power in [[Eastern Europe]], and in 1949, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) led by [[Mao Zedong]] established the [[People's Republic of China]], which would later follow its own ideological path of Communist development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} [[Cuba]], [[North Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]] were among the other countries in the [[Third World]] that adopted or imposed a pro-Communist government at some point. Although never formally unified as a single political entity, by the early 1980s almost one-third of the world's population lived in [[Communist state]]s, including the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]]. By comparison, the [[British Empire]] had ruled up to one-quarter of the world's population at its greatest extent.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hildreth |first=Jeremy |title=The British Empire's Lessons for Our own |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB111870387824258558.html |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2005-06-14 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

Communist states such as Soviet Union and China succeeded in becoming industrial and technological powers, challenging the capitalists' powers in the [[arms race]] and [[space race]] and military conflicts.

===Cold War years===
[[File:Sputnik-stamp-ussr.jpg|right|150px|thumb|USSR postage stamp depicting the [[communist state]] launching the first artificial satellite [[Sputnik 1]].]]

By virtue of the Soviet Union's victory in the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1945, the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] had occupied nations in both [[Eastern Europe]] and [[East Asia]]; as a result, communism as a movement spread to many new countries. This expansion of communism both in Europe and Asia gave rise to a few different branches of its own, such as [[Maoism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Communism had been vastly strengthened by the winning of many new nations into the sphere of Soviet influence and strength in Eastern Europe. Governments modeled on Soviet Communism took power with Soviet assistance in [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]]. A Communist government was also created under [[Joseph Tito|Marshal Tito]] in [[Yugoslavia]], but Tito's independent policies led to the expulsion of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from the [[Cominform]], which had replaced the [[Comintern]]. [[Titoism]], a new branch in the world communist movement, was labeled ''[[deviationism|deviationist]]''. [[Albania]] also became an independent Communist nation after World War II.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

By 1950, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] held all of [[Mainland China]], thus controlling the most populous nation in the world. Other areas where rising Communist strength provoked dissension and in some cases led to actual fighting through conventional and [[guerrilla warfare]] include the [[Korean War]], [[Laos]], many nations of the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], and notably succeeded in the case of the [[Vietnam War]] against the [[Armed forces|military power]] of the United States and its allies. With varying degrees of success, Communists attempted to unite with [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[socialism|socialist]] forces against what they saw as [[Western world|Western]] [[imperialism]] in these poor countries.

===Fear of communism===
[[File:Is this tomorrow.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A 1947 [[propaganda]] book published by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society "warning of the dangers" of a Communist takeover.]]
{{Main|Red Scare}}

With the exception of the Soviet Union's, China's and the [[Italian resistance movement]]'s great contribution in [[World War II]], communism was seen as a rival, and a threat to western democracies and capitalism for most of the twentieth century.<ref name="encarta"/> This rivalry peaked during the [[Cold War]], as the world's two remaining superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, polarized the world into two camps of nations (characterized in the West as "The Free World" vs. "Behind the Iron Curtain"); supported the spread of their economic and political systems (capitalism and democracy vs. communism); strengthened their military power, developed new weapon systems and stockpiled [[nuclear weapon]]s; competed with each other in space exploration; and even fought each other through proxy client nations.

Near the beginning of the Cold War, on February 9, 1950, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] from [[Wisconsin]] accused 205 Americans working in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] of being "card-carrying Communists".<ref>{{cite book |title=Without Precedent |last=Adams |first=John G. |year=1983 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=0-393-01616-1
|page=285}}</ref> The fear of communism in the U.S. spurred aggressive investigations and the [[red-baiting]], [[blacklist]]ing, jailing and deportation of people suspected of following Communist or other left-wing ideology. Many famous actors and writers were put on a "blacklist" from 1950 to 1954, which meant they would not be hired and would be subject to public disdain.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Hollywood Blacklist |last=Georgakas |first=Dan |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the American Left |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1992}}</ref>

===After the collapse of the Soviet Union===
[[File:Communist States.png|thumb|right|340px|This map shows the states which today are officially run by a Communist party alone: [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Cuba]].]]

In 1985, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became leader of the Soviet Union and relaxed central control, in accordance with reform policies of [[glasnost]] (openness) and [[perestroika]] (restructuring). The Soviet Union did not intervene as [[Poland]], [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], and [[Hungary]] all abandoned Communist rule by 1990. In 1991, the Soviet Union itself dissolved.

By the beginning of the 21st century, states controlled by Communist parties under a single-party system include the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], and informally [[North Korea]]. Communist parties, or their descendant parties, remain politically important in many countries. President [[Dimitris Christofias]] of [[Cyprus]] is a member of the [[Progressive Party of Working People]], but the country is not run under single-party rule. In [[South Africa]], the [[SACP|Communist Party]] is a partner in the [[African National Congress|ANC]]-led government. In [[India]], communists lead the governments of three [[states and territories of India|states]], with a combined population of more than 115 million. In [[Nepal]], communists hold a majority in the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly|parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11057207&fsrc=nwl |title=Nepal's election The Maoists triumph Economist.com |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-04-17 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

The People's Republic of China has reassessed many aspects of the Maoist legacy; and the People's Republic of China, Laos, Vietnam, and, to a far lesser degree, Cuba have reduced state control of the economy in order to stimulate growth. The People's Republic of China runs [[Special Economic Zone]]s dedicated to market-oriented enterprise, free from [[central government]] control. Several other communist states have also attempted to implement market-based reforms, including Vietnam.

Theories within Marxism as to why communism in Eastern Europe was not achieved after socialist revolutions pointed to such elements as the pressure of external capitalist states, the relative backwardness of the societies in which the revolutions occurred, and the emergence of a bureaucratic stratum or class that arrested or diverted the transition press in its own interests. (Scott and Marshall, 2005) Marxist critics of the Soviet Union, most notably Trotsky, referred to the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Soviet system]], along with other Communist states, as "[[degenerated workers' state|degenerated]]" or "[[deformed workers' state]]s", arguing that the Soviet system fell far short of Marx's communist ideal and he claimed the [[working class]] was politically dispossessed. The ruling stratum of the Soviet Union was held to be a bureaucratic [[caste]], but not a new [[ruling class]], despite their political control. Anarchists who adhere to [[Participatory economics]] claim that the Soviet Union became dominated by powerful intellectual elites who in a capitalist system crown the proletariat’s labor on behalf of the bourgeoisie.

Non-Marxists, in contrast, have often applied the term to any society ruled by a Communist Party and to any party aspiring to create a society similar to such existing [[Nation state|nation-state]]s. In the [[social sciences]], societies ruled by Communist Parties are distinct for their single party control and their socialist economic bases. While some social and [[List of political scientists|political scientists]] applied the concept of "[[totalitarianism]]" to these societies, others identified possibilities for independent political activity within them,<ref>{{cite journal |author=H. Gordon Skilling |month=April | year=1966 |title=Interest Groups and Communist Politics |journal=World Politics |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=435–451 |doi=10.2307/2009764}}�UNIQ3ab34e171166e61b-HTMLCommentStrip7c7dfbc41ccbeb7000000002</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=[[J.

Today, Marxist revolutionaries are conducting armed insurgencies in [[India]], [[Philippines]], [[Peru]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], and [[Colombia]].

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticisms of communism}}

A diverse array of writers and political activists have published [[criticisms of communism|criticism of communism]], such as:
* Soviet bloc dissidents [[Lech Wałęsa]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Václav Havel]];
* Social theorists [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Raymond Aron]], [[Ralf Dahrendorf]], [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], and [[Karl August Wittfogel|Karl Wittfogel]];
* Economists [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Milton Friedman]];
* Historians and social scientists [[Robert Conquest]], [[Stéphane Courtois]], [[Richard Pipes]], and [[R. J. Rummel]];
* [[Anti-Stalinist left]]ists [[Ignazio Silone]], [[George Orwell]], [[Saul Alinsky]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Arthur Koestler]], and [[Bernard-Henri Levy]];
* Russian-born novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]]
* Philosophers [[Leszek Kołakowski]] and [[Karl Popper]].

Part of this criticism is on the policies adopted by one-party states ruled by Communist parties (known as "[[Communist state]]s"). Critics are specially focused on their economic performance compared to market based economies. Their [[human rights]] records are thought to be responsible for the flight of refugees from communist states, and are alleged{{Who|date=November 2008}} to be responsible for famines, purges and warfare resulting in deaths far in excess of previous empires, capitalist or Axis regimes.

Some writers, such as Courtois, argue that the actions of Communist states were the inevitable (though sometimes unintentional) result of Marxist principles;<ref>Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panne, Jean-Louis Margolin, [[Andrzej Paczkowski]], [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[Black Book of Communism|The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression]]'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, ISBN 978-0-674-07608-2</ref> thus, these authors present the events occurring in those countries, particularly under Stalin and Mao, as an argument against Marxism itself. Some critics were former Marxists, such as Wittfogel , who applied Marx's concept of "[[Oriental despotism]]" to Communist states such as the [[Soviet Union]],<ref>Wittfogel, Karl ''Oriental Despotism'', Vintage, 1981</ref> and Silone, Wright, Koestler (among other writers) who contributed essays to the book ''[[The God that Failed]]'' (the title refers not to the [[God|Christian God]] but to Marxism)<ref> Crossman, Richard, ed., ''[[The God That Failed]]''. [[Harper & Brothers|Harper & Bros]], 1949</ref>

There have also been more direct [[criticisms of Marxism]], such as criticisms of the [[labor theory of value]] or [[criticisms of Marxism#Marx's predictions|Marx's predictions]]. Nevertheless, Communist parties outside of the [[Warsaw Pact]], such as the Communist parties in Western Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, differed greatly.

Economic criticisms of communal and/or government property are described under [[criticisms of socialism]].
