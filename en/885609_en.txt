The '''Himalia group''' is a group of [[prograde]] [[irregular satellite]]s of [[Jupiter]] that follow similar [[orbit]]s to Himalia and are thought to have a common origin.

The known members of the group are (in order of increasing distance from Jupiter):
* [[Leda (moon)|Leda]]
* [[Himalia (moon)|Himalia]] (the largest, which gives its name to the group)
* [[Lysithea (moon)|Lysithea]]
* [[Elara (moon)|Elara]]
The initial orbit estimate of the recently discovered satellite [[S/2000 J 11]] also qualified it as a member of the group (it appeared to have the same [[orbital inclination|inclination]], and a slightly larger [[semi-major axis]])<ref name="SJ2003">

but its orbit is not known with adequate precision and the mean orbital elements have not yet been calculated.

The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) reserves names in '''-a''' for the moons in this group.

==Characteristics and origin==

The objects in the Himalia group have [[semimajor axis|semi-major axes]] (distances from Jupiter) in the range of 11.15 and 11.75 [[gigametre|Gm]], [[orbital inclination|inclination]]s between 26.6° and 28.3°, and [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricities]] of between 0.11 and 0.25.
In physical appearance, the group is very homogenous, all satellites displaying neutral colours ([[color index|colour indices]] B−V = 0.66 and V−R = 0.36) similar to those of [[C-type asteroid]]s. Given the limited dispersion of the orbital parameters and the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] homogeneity, it has been suggested that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from the  [[Asteroid Belt|main asteroid belt]].<ref name=Grav2003> Grav, Tommy; Holman, Matthew J.; Gladman, Brett J.; [[Kaare Aksnes|Aksnes, Kaare]] ''Photometric survey of the irregular satellites'', Icarus, '''166''',(2003), pp. 33-45. [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301016 Preprint]</ref> The radius of the parent asteroid was probably about 89&nbsp;km, only slightly larger than that of Himalia, which retains approximately 87% of the mass of the original body. This indicates the asteroid was not heavily disturbed.<ref name="SJ2003"/>

[[Numerical integration]]s show a high probability of collisions among the members of the prograde group during the lifespan of the solar system (''e.g.''  on average 1.5 collisions between Himalia and Elara). In addition, the same simulations have shown fairly high probabilities of collisions between prograde and retrograde satellites (e.g. [[Pasiphae (moon)|Pasiphae]] and Himalia have a 27% probability of collision within 4.5 [[gigayear]]s). Consequently, it has been suggested that the current group could be a result of a more recent, rich collisional history among the prograde and retrograde satellites as opposed to the single break-up shortly after the planet formation that has been inferred for the [[Carme group|Carme]] and [[Ananke group]]s.<ref name="Nesvorny2004">
