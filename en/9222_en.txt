'''E''' is derived from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[epsilon]] which is much the same in appearance (Ε, ε) and function. In [[etymology]], the [[Semitic]] ''[[He (letter)|hê]]'' probably first represented a praying or calling human figure (''[[hillul]]'' jubilation), and was probably based on a similar [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] that was pronounced and used quite differently. In Semitic, the letter represented {{IPA|/h/}} (and {{IPA|/e/}} in foreign words), in Greek ''hê'' became  Εψιλον (Epsilon) with the value {{IPA|/e/}}.  [[Etruria|Etruscan]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] followed this usage. Arising from the [[Great Vowel Shift]], [[English language|English]] usage is rather different, namely {{IPA|/iː/}} (derived from {{IPA|/eː/}} in "me" or "bee") whereas other words like "bed" are closer to Latin and other languages in usage.

==Usage==
Like other [[Latin spelling and pronunciation#Vowels|Latin vowel]]s, E came in a long and a short variety.  Originally, the only difference was in length but later on, short e represented {{IPA|/ɛ/}}.  In other languages that use the [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] E or e, it represents various other phonetic values, sometimes with accents to indicate contrasts (e ê é è ë ē ĕ ě ẽ ė ẹ ę ẻ).

[[Digraphs]] starting with E are common in many languages to indicate [[diphthong]]s and [[monophthong]]s, such as EA or EE for {{IPA|/iː/}} or {{IPA|/eɪ/}} in English, EI for {{IPA|/aɪ/}} in [[German language|German]], or EU for {{IPA|/ø/}} in [[French language|French]] or {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}} in German.

At the end of a word, E is very often silent in English ([[silent e]]), where old noun [[inflections]] have been dropped, although even when silent at the end of a word, it often causes vowels in the word to be pronounced as [[diphthongs]], conventionally called [[Long vowel#Long vowels in English|long vowels]] (compare as a noun ''rat'' and as a verb ''rate'').

The letter 'E' is the most common (or highest [[Frequency (statistics)|frequency]]) letter in the [[English language]] (starting off the typographer's phrase [[ETAOIN SHRDLU]]) and many other related [[languages]], which has implications in both [[cryptography]] and [[data compression]]. This makes it a difficult and popular letter to use when writing [[lipogram]]s. [[Ernest Vincent Wright]]'s ''[[Gadsby: Champion of Youth|Gadsby]]'' (1939), is considered a "dreadful" novel, and that "at least part of Wright's narrative difficulties were caused by language restrictions imposed by the lack of ''E''."<ref>Ross Eckler, ''Making the Alphabet Dance: Recreational Word Play''. New York: St. Martin's Press (1996): 3</ref> Both [[Georges Perec]]'s novel ''[[A Void (novel)|A Void]]'' (''La Disparition'') (1969) and its English translation by Gilbert Adair omit the letter E and are considered better works.<ref>Eckler (1996): 3. Perec's novel "was so well written that at least some reviewers never realized the existence of a letter constraint."</ref>
