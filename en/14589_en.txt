'''Iowa''' ({{Audio-IPA|en-us-Iowa.ogg|/ˈaɪəwə/}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[Midwestern]] region of the [[United States of America]], an area often referred to as the "American [[Heartland]]."

==Geography==
===Boundaries===
[[Image:Iowa topography.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Topography of Iowa, with counties and major streams.]] Iowa is bordered by the [[Mississippi River]] on the east; the [[Missouri River]] and the [[Big Sioux River]] on the west; the northern boundary is a line along 43 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude.<ref>{{cite book |title=Preamble to the 1857 Constitution of the State of Iowa |url=http://www.legis.state.ia.us/Constitution.html#pre1 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref><ref group=note>It should be noted that the Missouri and Mississippi river boundaries are as they were mapped in the 19th century, which can vary from their modern courses.</ref>  The southern border is the [[Des Moines River]] and a line along approximately 40 degrees 35 minutes north, as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Missouri v.

The state capital, [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], is located in [[Polk County, Iowa|Polk County]].

===Geology and terrain===
{{Main|Geology of Iowa}}
Iowa's bedrock geology generally increases in age from west to east. In northwest Iowa [[Cretaceous]] bedrock is ca. 74 million years old, in eastern Iowa [[Cambrian]] bedrock dates to ca. 500 million years ago.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Prior |first1=Jean Cutler |others=Adapted from ''Iowa Geology 2007'', [[Iowa Department of Natural Resources]] |title=Geology of Iowa: Iowa's Earth History Shaped by Ice, Wind, Rivers, and Ancient Seas |url=http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/geoiowa/GEOIOWA.HTM |accessdate=August 9, 2009 |publisher=Iowa Department of Natural Resources Geological Survey}}</ref>

Despite popular perception, Iowa is generally not flat; most of the state consists of rolling hills. Prior<ref>Prior, Jean C. (1991) ''Landforms of Iowa.'' University of Iowa Press, Iowa City. http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/landform.htm</ref> divides Iowa into eight [[landform]]s based on [[glaciation]], [[soil]]s, [[topography]], and [[river]] drainage.  [[Loess]] hills lie along the western border of the state, some of which are several hundred feet thick.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/info/loess/ | title= Geology of the Loess Hills, Iowa | year= 1999 | month= July | accessdate= 2008-03-26 | publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]]}}</ref>  In the northeast, along the Mississippi River, is a section of the [[Driftless Zone]], which in Iowa consists of steep hills and valleys which appear almost mountainous.

There are several natural lakes in the state, most notably [[Spirit Lake (Iowa)|Spirit Lake]], [[West Okoboji Lake]], and [[East Okoboji Lake]] in northwest Iowa (''see [[Iowa Great Lakes]]''). To the east lies [[Clear Lake, Iowa|Clear Lake]]. Man-made lakes include Lake Odessa,<ref name=Odessa>{{cite web|url=http://www.iowadnr.com/fish/fishing/lakes/ode58.html|title=Odessa|publisher=Iowa Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> [[Saylorville Lake]], [[Lake Red Rock (Des Moines River)|Lake Red Rock]], [[Coralville Lake]], Lake MacBride, and Rathbun Lake.  The northwest part of the state also contains a considerable number of remnants of the once common wetland areas such as [[Barringer Slough]].

===Ecology===
Iowa's natural vegetation is [[tallgrass prairie]] and [[savanna]] in upland areas, with dense forest and wetlands in floodplains and protected river valleys, and pothole wetlands in northern prairie areas.<ref>Prior, Jean C. (1991) ''Landforms of Iowa.'' University of Iowa Press, Iowa City.</ref> Most of Iowa is used for agriculture, crops cover 60% of the state, grasslands (mostly pasture and hay with some prairie and wetland) cover 30%, and forests cover 7%; urban areas and water cover another 1% each.<ref>Iowa DNR: Iowa's Statewide Land Cover Inventory, http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/landcvr/landcvr.htm</ref> Less than 1% of the tallgrass prairie that once covered most of Iowa remain intact, only about 5% of the state's prairie pothole wetlands remain, and most of the original forest has been lost.<ref>Iowa's Threatened and Endangered Species Program, http://www.iowadnr.gov/other/threatened.html</ref> Iowa ranks 49th of U.S. states in public land holdings.<ref>Iowa Must Step Up Investment in Public Lands "Des Moines Register", June 1, 2005, http://www.nicholasjohnson.org/politics/IaChild/eddmr601.html</ref> Threatened or endangered animals include the [[Bald Eagle]], [[Least Tern|Interior Least Tern]], [[Piping Plover]], [[Indiana Bat]], [[Sturgeon|Pallid Sturgeon]], the [[Discus macclintocki|Iowa Pleistocene Land Snail]], [[Mussel|Higgins' Eye Pearly Mussel]], and the [[Shiner (fish)|Topeka Shiner]].<ref>Federally Listed Animals in Iowa, http://www.agriculture.state.ia.us/livingOnTheEdge/endangeredAnimals.asp</ref> Endangered or threatened plants include [[Western Prairie Fringed Orchid]], [[Eastern Prairie Fringed Orchid]], [[Milkweed|Mead's Milkweed]], [[Bush Clover|Prairie Bush Clover]], and [[Northern Wild Monkshood]].<ref>Federally Listed Plants in Iowa, http://www.agriculture.state.ia.us/livingOnTheEdge/endangeredPlants.asp</ref>

===Climate===
[[Image:Iowa rainfall.jpg|thumb|right|Iowa annual rainfall, in inches.]]

Iowa, like most of the [[Midwest]], has a [[humid continental climate]] throughout the state ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') with extremes of both heat and cold. The average annual temperature at [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] is {{convert|50|F}}; for some locations in the north the figure is under {{convert|45|F}}, while [[Keokuk, Iowa|Keokuk]], on the [[Mississippi River]], averages {{convert|52|F}}. Winters are brisk and snowfall is common. Spring ushers in the beginning of the [[severe weather]] season.

{{Main|Iowa archaeology}}
{{main|Indians of Iowa}}
When [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a [[Pleistocene]] glacial landscape. By the time European explorers visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500-2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased. More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increase reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about A.D. 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements. The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]]. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the [[Illiniwek]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Sauk]].<ref>Alex, Lynn M.

===Trade and Indian removal, 1814-1832===
The U.S. encouraged settlement of the east side of the Mississippi and removal of Indians to the west. Trade continued in furs and lead, but disease and forced population movement decimated Indian cultures and economies. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] that surrendered much of [[Illinois]] to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa. The Sauk and Meskwaki were pushed out of the Mississippi valley in 1832, out of the [[Iowa River]] valley in 1843, and out of Iowa altogether in 1846, although many Meskwaki clandestinely returned, founding the [[Meskwaki Settlement]] that remains to this day. The [[Ho-Chunk]] were removed in 1850, and the [[Sioux|Dakota]] were removed by the late 1850s. Western Iowa around modern [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]] was used as a way station for other tribes being moved west, including the [[Potawatomi]].

===U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832-1860===
[[Image:Iowa territorial seal.jpg|thumb|100px|Iowa Territorial Seal.]] The first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.<ref name=Settlers>{{cite web|url=http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-1.html|title=History of Iowa|publisher=Iowa State University|author=Schwieder, Dorothy|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>  Primarily, they were families from [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]].<ref name=Settlers/>  On July 4, 1838, the [[U.S. Congress]] established the [[Territory of Iowa]].  President [[Martin Van Buren]] appointed [[Robert Lucas]] governor of the territory, which at the time had 22 counties and a population of 23,242.<ref>Iowa Official Register, Volume Number 60, page 314</ref>

Almost immediately after achieving territorial status, a clamor arose for statehood.  On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29<sup>th</sup> state in the Union when President [[James K. Polk]] signed Iowa's admission bill into law.  Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Indians. Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.<ref>"Official Encouragement of Immigration to Iowa", Marcus L. Hansen, ''IJHP", 19 (April 1921):159-95</ref>

===Civil War, 1861-1865===
Iowa supported the Union during the Civil War, voting heavily for [[Abraham Lincoln]], though there was a strong antiwar "[[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]]" movement among settlers of southern origins and among [[Catholics]]. There were no battles in the state, but Iowa sent large supplies of food to the armies and the eastern cities. Much of Iowa’s support for the Union can be attributed to [[Samuel J. Kirkwood]], its wartime governor.  Of a total population of 675,000, about 116,000 men were subjected to military duty.  Iowa contributed proportionately more men to Civil War military service than did any other state, north or south, sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, over one-sixth of whom were in their graves before [[Appomattox]].<ref name="Iowa Official Register page 315">Iowa Official Register, Volume No. 60, page 315</ref>

Most fought in the great campaigns in the [[Mississippi Valley]] and in the [[American South|South]].<ref>http://www.iowanationalguard.com/Museum/IA_History/CivilWar.htm</ref> Iowa troops fought at Wilson's Creek in [[Missouri]], Pea Ridge in [[Arkansas]], Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and Rossville Gap as well as Vicksburg, Iuka, and Corinth.  They served with the Army of the Potomoc in [[Virginia]] and fought under Union General [[Philip Sheridan]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]].  Many died and were buried at Andersonville.  They marched on General [[Nathaniel Banks]]' ill-starred expedition to the Red River.  Twenty-seven [[Iowans]] won the [[Congressional Medal of Honor]], first awarded in the Civil War.<ref>Iowa Official Register, Volume No. 60, pages 315-316</ref>

Iowa had several brigadier generals and four major generals—[[Grenville Mellen Dodge]], Samuel B. Curtis, [[Francis J. Herron]], and [[Frederick Steele]]—and saw many of its generals go on to state and national prominence following the war.<ref name="Iowa Official Register page 315"/>

===Agricultural expansion, 1865-1930===
[[Image:Barclay barn 1875.jpg|thumb|Iowa farm, 1875.]]
Following the Civil War, Iowa's population continued to grow dramatically, from 674,913 people in 1860 to 1,194,020 in 1870. The introduction of railroads in the 1850s and 1860s transformed Iowa into a major agricultural producer. In 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]] and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity. In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first farm-related industries developed in the 1870s, Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations. 

===Depression, World War II, and the rise of manufacturing, 1930-1985===
The transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization that continues. The period since World War II has witnessed a particular increase in manufacturing operations. While [[agriculture]] continued to be the state's dominant industry, Iowans also produce a wide variety of products including refrigerators, washing machines, fountain pens, farm implements, and food products. The Farm Crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing poverty not seen since the Depression.<ref>The Midwest Farm Crisis of the 1980s, http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id395.htm</ref> The crisis spurred a major population decline in Iowa that lasted a decade.<ref name="iwin.iwd.state.ia.us">Population Trends: The Changing Face of Iowa, http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/ArticleReader?itemid=00003011</ref>

===Reemergence as a mixed economy, 1985-present===
After bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa’s economy began to become increasingly less dependent on agriculture, and now has a mix of manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services.<ref name="iowalifechanging.com">''Iowa Industries'', Iowa Workforce Development. http://www.iowalifechanging.com/downloads/iaindustries.pdf</ref> The population of Iowa has increased at a faster rate than the U.S. as a whole,<ref name="iwin.iwd.state.ia.us"/> and Iowa now has a predominantly urban population.<ref name="data.iowadatacenter.org">Iowa Data Center, 2000 Census: http://data.iowadatacenter.org/datatables/urbanrural/urstagesexbymalefemale2000.pdf</ref>

Iowa, in common with other Midwestern states (especially [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]]), is feeling the brunt of [[rural flight]], although Iowa has been gaining population since approximately 1990. Some smaller communities, such as [[Denison, Iowa|Denison]] and [[Storm Lake, Iowa|Storm Lake]], have mitigated this population loss through gains in immigrant laborers.<ref>In This Small Town in Iowa the Future Speaks Spanish.

===Religion===
[[Image:Amana Colonies.JPG|thumb|left|[[Amana Colonies]], founded by German [[Pietists]].]]
A 2001 survey from the [[City University of New York]] found that 52% of Iowans are [[Protestantism|Protestant]], while 23% are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and other religions made up 6%. 13% responded with non-religious, and 5% did not answer.<ref>{{cite web | title = American Religious Identification Survey 2001 | publisher = The Graduate Center of the City University of New York| url = http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_studies/aris.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-08-16}}</ref> The largest Protestant denominations by number of adherents are the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] with 268,543; and the [[United Methodist Church]] with 248,211.<ref>http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/19_2000.asp</ref>

The study also found rapid growth in Evangelical Christian denominations.

Historically, religious sects and orders who desired to live apart from the rest of society established themselves in Iowa, such as the [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite]] near [[Kalona, Iowa|Kalona]] and in other parts of eastern Iowa such as [[Davis County, Iowa|Davis County]] and [[Buchanan County, Iowa|Buchanan County]].<ref>Elmer Schwieder and Dorothy Schwieder (2009) ''A Peculiar People: Iowa's Old Order Amish'' University of Iowa Press</ref> Other religious sects and orders living apart include [[Quakers]] around [[West Branch, Iowa|West Branch]] and [[Le Grand, Iowa|Le Grand]], German [[Pietists]] who founded the [[Amana Colonies]], followers of [[Transcendental Meditation]] who founded [[Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa|Maharishi Vedic City]], and [[Cistercian]] monks and nuns at the [[New Melleray Abbey|New Melleray]] and [[Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbey|Our Lady of the Mississippi]] Abbies near [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]].

===Linguistic regions===

Berlin, Germany: Mouton de Gruyter, 2006. http://www.mouton-online.com/anae.php </ref> found that the English spoken in Iowa divides into two large linguistic regions. Natives of northern Iowa — including [[Sioux City]], [[Fort Dodge]], and the [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]] region — tend to speak the dialect that linguists call [[North Central American English]], which is also found in [[North]] and [[South Dakota]], [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Michigan]]. Natives of central and southern Iowa — including such cities as [[Council Bluffs]], [[Des Moines]], and [[Iowa City]] — tend to speak the "North Midlands" dialect also found in Nebraska, central Illinois, and northern Indiana.<ref>{{cite web | title = Atlas of North American English | publisher = The University of Pennsylvania| url = http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/MapsNC/Map1NC.html | accessdate = 2008-01-05}}</ref>

Directly and indirectly, agriculture has always been a major component of Iowa's economy. However, the direct production and sale of raw agricultural products contributes only about 3.5% of Iowa's gross state product.<ref> 2007 ''Iowa Factbook'' p. 59, Des Moines:Iowa Legislative Services Agency.</ref> The indirect role of agriculture in Iowa's economy can be measured in multiple ways, but its total impact, including agriculture-affiliated business, has been measured at 16.4% in terms of value added and 24.3% in terms of total output. This is lower than the economic impact in Iowa of non-farm manufacturing, which accounts for 22.4% of total value added and 26.5% of total output.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/isu/genres/10180.html|title=Multiple Measures of the Role of Agriculture in Iowa's Economy}}</ref>  Iowa's main agricultural outputs are [[pig|hogs]], [[maize|corn]], [[soybean]]s, [[oat]]s, [[cattle]], eggs, and [[dairy]] products. Iowa is the nation's largest producer of [[ethanol]] and [[maize|corn]].  Major Iowa agricultural product processors include [[Cargill, Inc.]], [[Pioneer Hi-Bred International]], [[Monsanto Company]], [[Ajinomoto]], [[Hy-Vee]], Garst Seed Company, and Heartland Pork Enterprises.

Iowa imposes taxes on net state income of individuals and estates and trusts. There are currently nine [[income tax]] brackets, ranging from 0.36% to 8.98%. The state [[sales tax]] rate is 6%, with non-prepared food having no tax.<ref>Iowa Department of Revenue, Iowa Tax / Fee Descriptions and Rates, http://www.iowa.gov/tax/taxlaw/taxtypes.html#sales</ref> Iowa has two local option sales taxes that may be imposed by counties after an election, a ''regular'' local option tax and a ''school infrastructure'' local option tax.<ref>Iowa Department of Revenue, Iowa Local Option Tax Information, http://www.iowa.gov/tax/educate/localoption.html</ref> Property tax is levied on the taxable value of real property, Iowa has more than 2,000 taxing authorities. Most property is taxed by more than one taxing authority. The tax rate differs in each locality and is a composite of county, city or rural township, [[school district]] and special levies. Iowa allows its residents to deduct their [[federal income tax]]es from their state income taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009905300328|title=No tax increases planned for next year, Culver says|author=Thomas Beaumont|work=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=2009-05-30|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref>

Iowa is currently listed as a [[swing state]] in national politics. The state currently leans slightly [[Democratic]], according to the [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]], which by analyzing recent elections gives Iowa a score of D+1. However, the state is far from homogeneous in its political leanings; Cook finds that Iowa's five political districts range in political orientation. [[Iowa's 2nd congressional district]], in the Eastern/Southeastern part of the state, leans distinctly Democratic, with a D+7 (strong Democratic) score; but [[Iowa's 5th congressional district]], which covers most of Western Iowa, leans strongly Republican, scoring R+9.

From 1968 to 1984, Iowa voted for the Republican candidate in the presidential election, and from 1988 to 2000 the state voted for the Democrat; in the latter election, the Democratic candidate won by little more than 1000 votes. In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] election, Iowa went by about 10,000 votes for [[George W. Bush]] but in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]], [[Barack Obama]] won by a much larger margin of about 150,000 votes.

In the 2006 elections, the Iowa Democrats gained two seats in the Iowa delegation to the [[United States House of Representatives]], and Democrats won a majority in both houses of the [[Iowa General Assembly]].

===Presidential caucus===
{{Main|Iowa caucus}}
The state gets considerable attention every four years because it holds the first presidential [[Iowa caucus|caucuses]], gatherings of voters to select delegates to the state conventions. Along with the [[New Hampshire primary]] the following week, Iowa's caucuses have become the starting points for choosing the two major-party candidates for president. The caucuses, held in January of the election year, involve people gathering in homes or public places and choosing their candidates, rather than casting secret ballots as is done in a [[Presidential primary|primary]] [[election]]. The national and international media give Iowa (and [[New Hampshire]]) much of the attention accorded the national candidate selection process, which gives Iowa voters enormous leverage. Those who enter the caucus race often expend enormous effort to reach voters in each of Iowa's 99 counties.

===Civil rights===
[[Image:union block.jpg|thumb||The [[Union Block (Mount Pleasant, Iowa)|Union Block]] building, [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa|Mount Pleasant]], scene of early civil rights and women’s rights activities. Listed as one of the most endangered historic sites in Iowa.<ref>[[Iowa Historic Preservation Alliance]]: Iowa’s Most Endangered Historic Sites, http://www.iowapreservation.org/endangered.php</ref>]]
In the 19th century Iowa was among the earliest states to enact prohibitions against race discrimination, especially in education, but was slow to achieve full integration in the 20th century. In the very first decision of the [[Iowa Supreme Court]] — ''In Re the Matter of Ralph'',<ref>1 Morris 1 (Iowa 1839)</ref> decided July 1839 — the Court rejected slavery in a decision that found that a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years before the end of the Civil War.<ref name="civil rights">http://www.judicial.state.ia.us/Public_Information/Iowa_Courts_History/Civil_Rights/</ref> The state did away with racial barriers to marriage in 1851, more than 100 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would ban [[Anti-miscegenation laws|miscegenation statutes]] nationwide.<ref name="ChicagoTrib">[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-defending-iowa-web,0,2979128.story Gay marriage and Iowa: Why's everyone so surprised?], [[Chicago Tribune]], April 10, 2009</ref> The Iowa Supreme Court decided ''Clark v. The Board of Directors''<ref>24 Iowa 266 (1868)</ref> in 1868, ruling that racially segregated “separate but equal” schools had no place in Iowa, 85 years before ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.<ref name="civil rights" /> By 1875 a number of additional court rulings effectively ended segregation in Iowa schools.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brodnax|first=David|date=2004|title=The Equality of Right: Alexander Clark and the Desegregation of Iowa’s Public Schools, 1834-1875|journal=Law and Society Association|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/1/7/4/2/p117420_index.html}}</ref> Social and housing discrimination continued against Blacks at state universities until the 1950s.<ref>Breaux, Richard M.

Information Age, Greenwich</ref> The Court heard ''Coger v. The North Western Union Packet Co.''<ref>37 Iowa 145 (1873)</ref> in 1873, ruling against racial discrimination in public accommodations 91 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.<ref name="civil rights" /> In 1884, the Iowa Civil Rights Act apparently outlawed discrimination by businesses, reading: "All persons within this state shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, chophouses, eating houses, lunch counters, and all other places where refreshments are served, public conveyances, barber shops, bathhouses, theaters, and all other places of amusement." However, the courts chose to narrowly apply this act, allowing de-facto discrimination to continue.<ref>Iowa Civil Rights Commission, http://www.iowa.gov/government/crc/docs/annual66activities.html</ref> Racial discrimination at public businesses was not deemed illegal until 1949, when the court ruled in ''[[State of Iowa v. Katz]]'' that businesses had to serve customers regardless of race; the case began when [[Edna Griffin]] was denied service at a Des Moines drugstore.<ref>African-Americans in Iowa, 1838-2005, http://www.iptv.org/IowaPathways/myPath.cfm?ounid=ob_000238</ref> Full racial civil rights were codified under the Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965.<ref>Iowa Civil Rights Commission http://www.state.ia.us/government/crc/publications/brochures/english_brochure.html</ref>

As with racial equality, Iowa was a vanguard in women's rights in the mid 19th century, but was slow to give women the right to vote. In 1847, the [[University of Iowa]] became the first public university in the U.S. to admit men and women on an equal basis.<ref>About Iowa, http://www.uiowa.edu/homepage/about-UI/index.html</ref> In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law, with the Court ruling that women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa and admitting [[Arabella A. Mansfield]] to the practice of law.<ref name="civil rights" /> Several attempts to grant full voting rights to Iowa women were defeated between 1870 and 1919. In 1894 women were given "partial suffrage", which allowed them to vote on issues, but not for candidates. It was not until the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified in 1920 that women had full suffrage in Iowa.<ref>The Fight for Women's Suffrage, http://www.iptv.org/iowapathways/myPath.cfm?ounid=ob_000320</ref> Although Iowa supported the Federal [[Equal Rights Amendment]], in 1980 and 1992 Iowa voters rejected an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution.<ref>How Did Iowa Coalitions Campaign for the Equal Rights Amendment in 1980 and 1992? http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/iowaera/intro.htm</ref>

Post-[[Civil Rights era]] court decisions in Iowa clarified and expanded citizens' rights. The landmark U.S. Supreme Court case [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District|Tinker v. Des Moines]] (1969) confirmed the right of students to express political views. On April 3, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court decided ''[[Varnum v. Brien]]'',<ref>WL 874044
(Iowa 2009) (Publication to N.W.2d pending as of April 09, 2009.)</ref> holding in a [[unanimous]] decision,<ref>http://iowaindependent.com/13495/iowa-supreme-court-same-sex-couples-can-marry-in-iowa</ref> that the state’s law forbidding [[same-sex marriage]] was [[unconstitutional]].  This makes Iowa the third state in the U.S. and first in the Midwest to permit same-sex marriage.<ref>http://hrcbackstory.org/2009/04/breaking-iowa-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-marriage-equality</ref>
