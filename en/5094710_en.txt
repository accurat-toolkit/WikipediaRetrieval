The '''flag of Australia''' is the [[national flag]] of [[Australia]].  Its original design was chosen in 1901 from entries in a worldwide competition held following [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. It was first flown in [[Melbourne]] on 3 September 1901. A slightly different design was approved by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1902. Over the next few years, the exact specifications of the [[flag]] were changed several times both intentionally and as a result of confusion. The current specifications were formally gazetted in 1934, and in 1954 the flag became recognised by parliamentary statute as the "'''Australian National Flag'''".

The flag is a [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] [[Blue Ensign]]: a blue field with the [[Union Flag]] in the canton (upper hoist quarter), and a large white seven-pointed star known as the [[Commonwealth Star]] in the lower hoist quarter. The [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]] contains a representation of the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] constellation, made up of five white stars – one small five-pointed star and four, larger, seven-pointed stars.

The flag of Australia is legally defined in the ''[[Flags Act 1953]]''. In addition there are other official flags representing Australia, its people and core functions of government.

==Devices==

The Australian flag uses three prominent symbol, the ''Union Jack, the [[Commonwealth Star]] (also the ''Federation Star'') and the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] (or ''Crux'').<Ref name="af23">''Australian Flags, pp. 2–3.</ref>

The Union Flag is thought locally to symbolise Australia's history as six British colonies and the principles upon which the [[Australian Federation]] is based,<Ref name="af23"/><ref>Source: Australian Flag Society</ref> although a more historic view sees its inclusion in the design as demonstrating loyalty to the [[British Empire]].<ref name="evans">Evans, I. 1918. ''The history of the Australian flag''. Evan Evans, Melbourne</ref>

The Commonwealth Star originally had only six points, representing the six federating colonies. However, this changed in 1908 when a seventh point was added to symbolise the [[Papua (Australian territory)|Territory of Papua]] and any future territories.<ref name="af23"/><Ref name="af41">''Australian Flags'', p. 41.</ref> The Commonwealth Star does not have any relation to [[Beta Centauri]], despite that star's coincidental location in the sky and its brightness.

The [[Southern Cross]] is one of the most distinctive [[constellation]]s visible in the Southern Hemisphere,<ref name="af23"/> and has been used to represent Australia since the early days of British settlement.<Ref name="af23"/> Ivor Evans, one of the flag's designers, intended the Southern Cross to refer also to the four moral virtues ascribed to the four main stars by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]: justice, prudence, temperance and fortitude.<Ref>Kwan, p. 143.</ref> The number of points on the stars of the Southern Cross on today's Australian flag differs from the original competition-winning design, on which they ranged between five and nine points each, representing their relative brightness in the night sky.<ref name="af23"/> In order to simplify manufacture, the British [[Admiralty]] standardised the four larger outer stars at seven points each, leaving the smaller middle star with five points.

A complete specification for the current design was published in the ''Commonwealth Gazette'' in 1934.<ref>''Commonwealth of Australia Gazette'' No. 18, 23 March 1934</ref>

==Construction==
[[File:Flag of Australia template.svg|right|thumb|360px|Construction sheet for the Flag of Australia. The length of the Flag is twice the width.]]
Under the Flags Act, the Australian National Flag must meet the following specifications:<ref name="flagsact">[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fa195361/ Flags Act 1953]</ref>
<ol type="a">
<li> the [[Union Flag]] occupying the upper quarter next the [[Flagpole_(structure)#Flagpoles|staff]];<Ref name="af1">''Australian Flags'', p. 1.</ref>
<li> a large white star (representing the 6 States of Australia and the Territories) in the centre of the lower quarter next the pye and pointing direct to the centre of [[Flag of England|St George's Cross]] in the Union Flag;<ref name="af1"/>
<li> 5 white stars (representing the [[Crux|Southern Cross]]) in the half of the flag further from the staff.<Ref name="af1"/>
</ol>

The location of the stars is as follows:<Ref name="af1"/>
*Commonwealth Star – 7 pointed star, centred in lower hoist.<Ref name="af1"/>
*''[[Alpha Crucis]]'' – 7 pointed star, straight below centre fly 1/6 up from bottom edge.<Ref name="af1"/>
*''[[Beta Crucis]]'' – 7 pointed star, 1/4 of the way left and 1/16 up from the centre fly.<Ref name="af1"/>
*''[[Gamma Crucis]]'' – 7 pointed star, straight above centre fly 1/6 down from top edge.<Ref name="af1"/>
*''[[Delta Crucis]]'' – 7 pointed star, 2/9 of the way right and 31/240 up from the centre fly.<Ref name="af1"/>
*''[[Epsilon Crucis]]'' – 5 pointed star, 1/10 of the way right and 1/24 down from the centre fly.<Ref name="af1"/>
The outer diameter of the Commonwealth Star is 3/10 of the flag's width, while that of the stars in the Southern Cross is 1/7 of the flag's width, except for ''Epsilon'', for which the fraction is 1/12. Each star's inner diameter is 4/9 of the outer diameter. The flag's width is the measurement of the hoist edge of the flag (the distance from top to bottom).<Ref name="af1"/>

==Colours==

==1901 Federal Flag Design Competition==

Before 1901, Australia was a collection of six [[British colonies]]. The Union Flag, as the flag of the British Empire,<Ref name="af23"/> was often used to represent them collectively, and each colony also had its own flag based on the Union Flag.<ref name="af37">''Australian Flags'', p. 37.</ref> Two attempts were made throughout the nineteenth century to design a national flag. The first such attempt was the [[National Colonial Flag for Australia|National Colonial Flag]] created in 1823–1824  by Captain John Nicholson and Captain John Bingle.<Ref name="af37"/> The most popular "national" flag of the period was the 1831 [[Australian Federation Flag|Federation Flag]], also designed by Nicholson. These flags, and many others such as the [[Eureka Flag]] (which came into use at the [[Eureka Stockade]] in 1854), featured stars representing the Southern Cross.<ref name="af38">''Australian Flags'', p. 38.</ref> The oldest known flag to show the stars arranged as they are seen in the sky is the [[Australasian Anti-Transportation League Flag|Anti-Transportation League Flag]], which is similar in design to the present National Flag.

[[File:reviewofreviews.jpg|thumb|The edition of the Review of Reviews front cover signed by Egbert Nuttall, after the winning designers of the 1901 Federal Flag design competition were announced.]]
As Federation approached, thoughts turned to an official federal flag. In 1900, the ''Melbourne Herald'' conducted a design competition in which entries were required to include the Union Flag and Southern Cross, resulting in a British Ensign style flag.<ref name="k16">Kwan, p. 16.</ref> The competition conducted by the ''Review of Reviews for Australasia'' later that year thought such a restriction seemed unwise, despite observing that a design without these emblems were unlikely to be successful.<ref name="k16"/> After [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] on 1 January 1901, the new [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] held an official competition for a new federal flag in April. The competition attracted over 32,000 entries,<ref name="af39"/> including many originally sent to the ''Review of Reviews''.<ref name="af39">''Australian Flags'', p. 39.</ref> The designs were judged on seven criteria: loyalty to the Empire, Federation, history, heraldry, distinctiveness, utility and cost of manufacture.<ref name="evans" /> The majority of designs incorporated the Union Flag and the Southern Cross, but native animals were also popular.<ref name="af40"/> Five almost identical entries were chosen as the winning design, and their designers shared the 200 [[Australian pound|pounds]] prize money. They were Ivor Evans, a fourteen-year-old schoolboy from [[Melbourne]]; Leslie John Hawkins, a teenager apprenticed to an optician from [[Sydney]]; Egbert John Nuttall, an architect from Melbourne; Annie Dorrington, an artist from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]; and William Stevens, a ship's officer from [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The five winners received 40 pounds each.<ref name="af40">''Australian Flags'', p. 40.</ref>

On 3 September 1901, the new Australian flag flew for the first time atop the [[Royal Exhibition Building]] in Melbourne.<Ref name="af40"/>  The names of the joint winners of the design competition were announced by [[Hersey, Marchioness of Linlithgow|Hersey, Countess of Hopetoun]] (the wife of the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], the [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|7th Earl of Hopetoun]]) and she unfurled the flag for the first time.<ref>[http://www.australianflag.com.au/federal.php ANFA]</ref><ref>[http://home.overflow.net.au/~nedwood/flag.html Under the Southern Cross]</ref>

[[File:Royal exhibition building tulips.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne. Site of the first flying of the Australian flag.]]

A simplified version of the competition-winning design was officially approved as the Flag of Australia by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1902.<ref>''Commonwealth of Australia Gazette'' No. 8, 20 February 1903</ref>

It replaced the [[Union Flag]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] at St Louis in 1904. In the same year, due to lobbying by Senator [[Richard Crouch]], it had the same status as the Union Flag in the UK, when the House of Representatives proclaimed that the Blue Ensign ''"should be flown upon all forts, vessels, saluting places and public buildings of the Commonwealth upon all occasions when flags are used"''.<Ref name="k32">Kwan, p. 32.</ref> The government agreed to fly the Blue Ensign on special flag days, but not if it meant additional expense, which undermined the motion.<Ref name="k32"/> The Blue Ensign could only be flown on a state government building if a state flag was not available<ref name="Flag"/>.

==Blue or Red Ensign?==

The Red Ensign was the only flag private citizens could fly on land.<ref name="Flag"/> By traditional British understanding, the Blue Ensign would be reserved for Commonwealth Government use, with State and local governments, private organisations and individuals all using the Red Ensign.<ref name="Flag"/>

In 1908 the Blue Ensign replaced the [[Union Flag]] at all military establishments. From 1911 it was the saluting flag of the Australian army at all reviews and ceremonial parades,<ref> M.O.58 (1908) Attention is directed to Statutory Rule 27/08 published in M.O. 58/08. The Australian Ensign will accordingly be flown at all flag stations throughout the Commonwealth. M.O.135 (1911) It is directed that in future the Australian Flag is to be used as the saluting flag at all reviews and ceremonial parades. [http://www.australianflag.org.au/militaryorders.php Source: Australian Army Military Orders]</ref> although when Australia's new [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] was opened in 1927, only Red Ensigns and Union Flags were flown.<ref name="Flag"/><Ref>Kwan, pp. 84–85.</ref><ref>Due to lack of eyewitness accounts there is some doubt over whether Septimus Power's painting is accurate with claims the red was possibly chosen for dramatic effect.</ref>

There was some confusion over military use of the ensigns with the result that prior to 1941 almost 10 per cent of military ensigns were Blue rather than the more common Red Ensigns.<ref>[http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-flags/red_ensign.htm Australia's Forgotten Flag. The Red Ensign] Digger History: history of the Australian & New Zealand Armed Forces</ref>

Technically, private non-commercial vessels were liable to a substantial fine if they did not fly the British Red Ensign. However, an Admiralty Warrant was issued on 5 December 1938, authorising these vessels to fly the Australian Red Ensign.

The ''Shipping Registration Act 1981'' reaffirmed that the Australian Red Ensign was the proper "colours" for commercial ships over 24 metres in tonnage length.<ref name="k113">Kwan, p. 113.</ref>

==Union Flag==
As part of the [[British Empire]], Australia originally flew the Union Flag. It was the defacto flag of the British Empire, originally established as a Royal flag.<ref>Sources: Buckingham Palace and the College of Arms.</ref>

The [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) was promulgated on 5 October 1911 and were directed to fly the British [[White Ensign]] on the stern and the Flag of Australia on the [[Jackstaff]].<ref>George Odgers, "The Royal Australian Navy - An Illustrated History", p. 41</ref><ref name="af44"/><ref name="k54">Kwan, p. 54.</ref> Despite the government wanting to use the Blue Ensign on Australian warships, officers continued to fly the Union Flag, and it was not until 1913, following public protest in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] after its use for the review of [[HMAS Melbourne (1912)|HMAS ''Melbourne'']], that the government "reminded" them of the 1911 legislation.<ref name="k55">Kwan, p. 55.</ref> The British White Ensign was finally replaced by a distinctively [[Australian White Ensign]] on 1 March 1967.<ref name="af44">''Australian Flags'', p. 44.</ref>

In the 1920s there was debate over whether the Blue Ensign was reserved for Commonwealth buildings only, culminating in a 1924 agreement that the [[Union Flag]] should take precedence as the National Flag.<ref name="Flag"/> As the Union Flag was recognised as the National flag, it was considered disloyal to fly either ensign without the Union flag alongside, and it was the Union Flag that covered the coffins of Australia's war dead.<ref name="Flag"/><Ref name="k8">Kwan, p. 8.</ref>

The Blue Ensign formally replaced the Union Flag on 14 April 1954.<ref name="af44"/> The Union Flag was still regarded as the National flag by many Australians well into the 1970s, which inspired Arthur Smout's campaign from 1968 to 1982 to encourage Australians to give the Australian flag precedence.<Ref name="k9">Kwan, p. 9.</ref>

By the mid-80s the Commonwealth Government no longer reminded Australians they had the right to fly the Union Flag alongside the National Flag or provided illustrations of how to correctly display them together.<ref>Elizabeth Kwan, Flag and Nation, 2004</ref>

The Union Flag ranks 2nd in the Australian Order of Precedence. <ref> Letter from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, 21/11/08 </ref>

==Australian National Flag==

[[File:Flags Act 1953.jpg|right|thumb|180px|The ''Flags Act 1953'' specified the Blue Ensign as the Australian National Flag and the [[Australian Red Ensign|Red Ensign]] as the merchant shipping flag.]]

In 1940 the Victorian government passed legislation allowing schools to purchase Blue Ensigns,<Ref name="k92">Kwan, p. 92.</ref> which in turn allowed its use by private citizens. Prime Minister Robert Menzies then encouraged private citizens to use the Blue Ensign, issuing a statement the following year allowing Australians to use either ensign.<ref name="Flag"/>

Prime Minister Ben Chifley issued a similar statement in 1947.<ref>Kwan, Elizabeth. 2006. ''Flag and Nation: Australians and their national flags since 1901'' UNSW Press ISBN 0-86840-567-1 pp.96–97</ref>

On 4 December 1950, the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Menzies]] proclaimed the Blue ensign as the National flag and in 1951 [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] approved the Government's recommendation.<ref> ^Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Awards and Culture Branch. 2006. Australian Flags symbols Australian Government Publishing Service. ISBN 0-642-47134-7</ref>

This status was formalised on 14 February 1954, when [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] gave [[Royal Assent]] to the ''[[Flags Act 1953]]''.<ref name="k106">Kwan, p. 106.</ref> The monarch's Assent was timed to coincide with the Queen's visit to the country.<ref name="k106"/> The Act confers statutory powers on the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] to appoint 'flags and ensigns of Australia' and authorise warrants and make rules as to use of flags. Section 8 ensures that the 'right or privilege' of a person to fly the Union Flag is not affected by the Act.

South Australia chose to continue with the Union Flag as National flag until 1956, when schools were given the option of using either the Union or Australian flags.<Ref>Kwan, pp. 104–105, 109.</ref>

In 1998, the ''Flags Act'' was amended by stipulating rules for changing the national flag's design; to replace the flag entirely, a referendum must be held – assuming the act is not amended by parliament through the normal processes.<ref>Department of the Parliamentary Library. 1996.

==Protocol==
Guidelines for flying the flag are laid out in the [[Flags Act 1953|1953 Flags Act]] and in a pamphlet entitled "The Australian National Flag", which is published by the Australian Government on an infrequent basis. The guidelines say that the Australian National Flag are allowed to be flown on every day of the year.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/flag.cfm#flag |title=Australian National Flag |accessdate=2008-08-12 |date=2008-05-29 |publisher=Government of Australia }}</ref> The National Flag must always be flown in a position superior to that of any other flag or ensign when flown in Australia or on Australian territory, and it should always be flown aloft and free.<ref name="af5">''Australian Flags'', p. 5.</ref> The flag must be flown in all government buildings and displayed in polling stations when there is a national election or referendum.<ref name="af21">''Australian Flags'', p. 21.</ref> Private pleasure craft can fly either the Red Ensign or the Australian National Flag.<Ref name="af17">''Australian Flags'', p. 17.</ref> The British Blue Ensign can be flown on an Australian owned ship instead of the Australian Flag if the owner has a warrant valid under British law.<ref>Department of Administrative Services. 1982.

The [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] also advises that the flag should only be flown during daylight hours, unless it is illuminated. Two flags should not be flown from the same flagpole.<ref name="af5"/> When the flag is flown at [[half-staff|half-mast]], it should be recognisably at half-mast, for example, a third of the way down from the top of the pole. The Australian Flag should never be flown half mast at night. Flags are flown at half-mast on government buildings:<ref name="af20"/>
*On the death of the [[Monarchy in Australia|Sovereign]] – from the time of announcement of the death up to and including the funeral. On the day the accession of the new Sovereign is proclaimed, it is customary to raise the flag to the top of the mast from 11&nbsp;am.

*On the death of the Governor-General or a former Governor-General.
*On the death of a distinguished Australian citizen. Flags in any locality may be flown at half-mast on the death of a notable local citizen or on the day, or part of the day, of their funeral.
*On the death of the head of state of another country with which Australia has diplomatic relations—the flag would be flown on the day of the funeral.
*On [[ANZAC day]] the flag is flown at half-mast until noon.
*On [[Remembrance Day]] flags are flown at peak until 10.30&nbsp;am, at half-mast from 10.30&nbsp;am to 11.03&nbsp;am, then at peak for the remainder of the day.<ref name="af20">''Australian Flags'', p. 20.</ref>

The Australian National Flag may be used for commercial or advertising purposes without formal permission as long as the flag is used in a dignified manner and reproduced completely and accurately; it should not be defaced by overprinting with words or illustrations, it should not be covered by other objects in displays, and all symbolic parts of the flag should be identifiable.<ref name="af21"/><ref>Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

For this reason the [[Collingwood Football Club]] had to reverse its logo (now current as of 2004).

There have been several attempts to make [[flag desecration|desecration]] of the Australian flag a crime. In 1953, during the second reading debate on the ''Flags Act'', the leader of the [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]], [[Arthur Calwell]], unsuccessfully called for provisions to be added to the bill to criminalise desecration.

On the centenary of the first flying of the flag, 3 September 2001, the [[Australian National Flag Association]] presented the Prime Minister with a flag intended to replace the missing original flag. This flag was not a replica of the original flag, on which the Commonwealth Star had only six points, but was a current Australian National Flag with a seven pointed Commonwealth Star. The flag has a special headband,<Ref name="k1401">Kwan, pp. 140–141.</ref> including a cardinal red stripe and the inscription
<blockquote>
The Centenary Flag. Presented to the Hon John Howard MP, Prime Minister of Australia on behalf of the people of Australia by the Australian National Flag Association on 3&nbsp;September 2001 at the Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne to commemorate the first flying of the Australian National Flag on 3 September 1901 attended by the Rt Hon Sir Edmund Barton MHR, Prime Minister of Australia.<ref name="k1401"/></blockquote>
A warrant authorising the use of the Centenary Flag under section 6 of the Flags Act was issued by the Governor-General and the flag is now used as the official flag of state on important occasions.<ref>''Commonwealth of Australia Gazette'' No. S382, 20 September 2001</ref>

==Other Australian flags==
{{main|List of Australian flags}}
Under Section 5 of the ''Flags Act 1953'', the Governor-General may proclaim flags other than the National Flag and the Red Ensign as flags or ensigns of Australia. Five flags have been appointed in this manner. The first two were the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the flags used by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. The [[Australian Army]] has no ensign of their own, but they are given the ceremonial task to be the defender of the National Flag.<ref name="defense"> {{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/otherflag.cfm#Defence |title=Other Australian Flags - Defence Ensigns |accessdate=2008-08-12 |date=2008-03-19 |publisher=Government of Australia }}</ref> The Air Force and the Navy flew the appropriate British ensigns (the [[White Ensign]] and the [[Royal Air Force Ensign]]) until the adoption of similar ensigns based on the Australian National Flag in 1948 and 1967 respectively.<Ref name="af29">''Australian Flags'', p. 29.</ref> The current Navy and Air Force Ensigns were officially appointed in 1967 and 1982 respectively.<Ref>''Australian Flags'', pp. 44–45.</ref>

In 1995, the [[Australian Aboriginal Flag|Aboriginal Flag]] and the [[Torres Strait Islander Flag]] were also appointed flags of Australia.<Ref name="af28">''Australian Flags'', p. 28.</ref> While mainly seen as a gesture of reconciliation, this recognition caused a small amount of controversy at the time, with then opposition leader [[John Howard]] describing it as divisive.<ref name="atsic">Kwan, pp. 133–135.</ref> Some [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] people, such as the flag's designer [[Harold Thomas]], felt that the government was appropriating their flag,<ref name="atsic"/> saying it "doesn't need any more recognition".<ref>Harold Thomas in ''Land Rights News'', July 1995, p. 3, cited in ''[http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/images/history/1970s/emb72/dowembassy.htm#symbolism  Aboriginal Tent Embassy: Icon or Eyesore?]''</ref>

The [[Australian Defence Force Ensign]] was proclaimed in 2000. This flag is used to represent the Defence Force when more than one branch of the military is involved, such as at the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]], and by the Minister for Defence.<Ref>Kwan, pp. 116, 126.</ref>

The Legislative Instruments Act 2003 required the proclamations of these flags to be lodged in a Federal Register. Due to an administrative oversight they were not, and the proclamations were automatically repealed.<ref> [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrument1.nsf/framelodgmentattachments/1996EAE0D6C3515ACA2573DB0010EEF8 Explanatory Statement accompanying 2008 proclamation], ComLaw database.</ref> The Governor-General issued new proclamations dated 25 January 2008, with effect from 1 January 2008 (or 1 October 2006 in the case of the Defence Force Ensign).<ref>[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Management.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200403962?OpenDocument&VIEW=enabling&COUNT=25&START=1 Legislative Instruments enabled by the Flags Act], ComLaw database.</ref>

In addition to the seven flags declared under the Flags Act, there are two additional Commonwealth flags, the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]
and [[Australian Customs Flag]],<Ref name="af30">''Australian Flags'', p. 30.</ref> eight Vice-Regal flags and nine State and Territory flags that are recognised as official flags through other means.<Ref>''Australian Flags'', pp. 31–35.</ref>

==The flag debate==

{{main|Australian flag debate}}
In connection with the issue of [[Australian republicanism|republicanism in Australia]] there have been low-key but persistent debates over whether or not the Australian flag should be changed in order to remove the Union Flag from the canton.<Ref name="bc">Kwan, pp. 125–129.</ref> This debate has come to a head at a number of occasions, such as in the period immediately preceding the [[Australian Bicentenary]] in 1988, and also during the Prime Ministership of [[Paul Keating]],<Ref name="bc"/> who publicly supported a change in the flag and was famously quoted as saying:
<blockquote>I do not believe that the symbols and the expression of the full sovereignty of Australian nationhood can ever be complete while we have a flag with the flag of another country on the corner of it.<ref>Hansard. 2 June 1994. [http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx?Folder=HANSARDR&Criteria=DOC_DATE:1994-06-02%3BSEQ_NUM:27%3B Question without Notice: Australian Flag], pp 1318</ref></blockquote>

There are two lobby groups involved in the flag debate: [[Ausflag]], who support changing the flag,<ref name="ausflag">Kwan, pp. 138–139.</ref> and the [[Australian National Flag Association]] (ANFA), who want to keep the current flag.<Ref>Kwan, p. 11.</ref> The primary arguments for keeping the flag cite historic precedence, while the arguments for changing the flag are based around the idea that the current flag does not accurately depict Australia's status as an independent and multicultural nation.<ref>Kwan, pp. 131–137.</ref>

Ausflag periodically campaigns for flag change in association with national events, like the [[2000 Summer Olympics]],<Ref>Kwan, p. 137.</ref> and holds flag design competitions,<Ref name="ausflag"/> while ANFA's activities include promotion of the current design through events like National Flag Day.<Ref>Kwan, p. 144.</ref>

Opinion polls show a significant majority of Australians favour no change. A 2004 NEWSPOLL that asked: ''"Are you personally in favour or against changing the Australian flag so as to remove the Union Jack emblem?"'' was supported by 32 per cent of respondents and opposed by 57 per cent, with 11 per cent uncommitted. <ref>Source: NEWSPOLL, 25 January 2004. <!--available here, but not available at the moment [http://www.newspoll.com.au/cgi-bin/polling/display_poll_data.pl]--></ref> <ref> According to a breakdown of the figures, 41 per cent said they were "strongly" opposed, more than favoured change overall. </ref> The level of support for a change in the flag has grown since the 1980s.<Ref>Kwan, pp. 125, 135.</ref>
