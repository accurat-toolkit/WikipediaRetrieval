|group="nb"}} ({{Audio-de|Hannover|De-Hannover-pronunciation.ogg}}, {{IPA2|haˈnoːfɐ}}), on the river [[Leine]], is the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Federal states of Germany|federal state]] of [[Lower Saxony]] (''Niedersachsen''), [[Germany]] and was once by [[personal union]] the family seat of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Kings of Great Britain]], in their dignities as the dukes of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]]  (which title was later called the [[Prince-Elector|Elector of Hanover]] at the end of the historical period known as [[Early Modern Europe]]). After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] ended, the Electorate was enlarged and made into the capital of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. 

In addition to being the capital of [[Lower Saxony]], Hanover was the capital of the administrative area ''Regierungsbezirk Hannover'' (''[[Hanover (region)|Hanover region]]'') until Lower Saxony's [[subnational entity|administrative regions]] were disbanded at the beginning of 2005. It is, however, still part of the [[Hanover (district)|Hanover district]] (''Region Hannover''), which is a municipal body made up from the former district and city of Hanover.

With a population of 522,944 (1 February 2007) the [[city]] is a major center of northern Germany, known for hosting annual commercial [[expo]]sitions such as the [[Hanover Fair]] and the [[wikt:CeBIT|CeBIT]]. Every year Hanover hosts the [[Schützenfest Hannover]], the world's largest Marksmen's Fun Fair, and the [[Oktoberfest_celebrations#Hanover|Oktoberfest Hannover]], which is the second largest [[Oktoberfest]] in the world. In 2000, Hanover hosted the world fair [[Expo 2000]]. The [[Hanover fairground]], due to numerous extensions especially for the Expo 2000, is the largest in the world. Hanover also has regional importance because of its universities and medical school, its international airport, and its large [[Hanover Zoo|zoo]]. The city is also a major crossing point of railway lines and highways ([[Autobahn]]en), connecting European main lines in east-west-direction ([[Berlin]] - [[Ruhr area]]) and north-south-direction ([[Hamburg]] - [[Munich]] et al.).

== History ==
{{Main| History of Hanover}}
Founded in medieval times on the south bank of the river [[Leine]] (the original name ''Honovere'' may be translated as "high bank", though this is debated), Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century as a natural crossroads. In a time of relatively difficult overland travel,  its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river favored it for increasing trade and growth.  Connected to the [[Hanseatic League]] city of [[Bremerhaven]] via the [[Leine]] river from its place near the southern edge of the wide [[Germany|central German plains]] to its north and situated north-west of the [[Harz]] mountains, it enjoyed a mountain skirting "[[Junction (road)|crossroad]]s" position in east-west land traffic by mule train. Hanover thus acted as a gateway to the [[Rhine]], the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] and [[Saar River]] valleys and their industrial areas to the southwest, for the plains regions both to its east and north, as well as overland traffic skirting the Hartz between the [[Low Countries]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] or [[Thuringia]]. 

In the 14th century the main [[Church (building)|churches]] of Hanover were built, as well as a [[city wall]] with three [[town gates]] to secure the city. With the beginnings of industrialization in Germany, trade in iron and silver from the northern Hartz mountains increased the city's importance.

In 1636 [[George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], ruling the [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]]ian Principality of [[Calenberg]], moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg ruling Calenberg were imperially elevated to the rank of [[Prince-elector]] in 1692 (confirmed by the [[Reichstag (institution)|Diet]] in 1708), thus their principality became upgraded into the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], however colloquially called [[Electorate of Hanover]] after Calenberg's capital (see also: [[House of Hanover]]). Its electors would later become in [[personal union]] monarchs of [[Great Britain]] (after 1801, monarchs of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]).  The first of them was [[George I of Great Britain|George I Louis]], who ascended to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who ruled in Hanover was [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]; [[Salic law]] forbade the accession of a woman in Hanover, in this case Queen Victoria of Great Britain and Ireland. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover.  Her descendants, however, were affiliated to her husband's titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.  Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were at the same time [[prince-elector|Electoral Princes]] of Hanover. 

During the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714&ndash;1837), the monarchs rarely visited the city.  In fact, during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760&ndash;1837), there was only one short visit, by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], in 1821. 1816–1837 [[Viceroy]] [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|Adolphus]] represented the monarch in Hanover.

During the [[Seven Years' War]]  the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]] took place on July 26, 1757, near the city. The [[France|French]] army defeated the [[Hanoverian Army of Observation]], leading to the city's occupation.

=== 19th century ===

[[File:Kroepke 1895.jpg|thumb|Am Kröpcke, 1895.]]
[[File:Hannover Schloss zu Herrenhausen (um 1895).jpg|thumb|right|Schloss Herrenhausen, 1895.]]
After [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] imposed the [[Convention of Artlenburg]] (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 30,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also meant the disbanding of the army of Hanover. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. As a result of this, a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrated to [[Great Britain]], leading to the formation of the [[King's German Legion]], which was the only German army to fight continually during the entire Napoleonic wars against the French. They later played an important role in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815. The [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814 elevated the electorate to the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the [[Leine]] and grew considerably since then.

In 1837, the [[personal union]] of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended as [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV's]] heir in the United Kingdom was female ([[Queen Victoria]]). According to [[Salic Law]] Hanover could only be inherited by males. As a consequence, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|Ernest Augustus]],  and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it  was annexed by [[Prussia]], during the [[Austro-Prussian war]]. Despite having won the [[Battle of Langensalza (1866)|Battle of Langensalza]] against Prussia,the city of Hanover became the Prussian provincial capital. After the annexation, the people of Hanover opposed the Prussian regime. 

However, for Hanoverian industry, the new connection to [[Prussia]] meant an improvement in business. The introduction of [[free trade]] promoted economic growth, and also led  to the recovery of the [[Gründerzeit]] (founders era). In the period from 1871 to 1912 the population of Hanover grew from 87,600 to 313,400. 

In 1872 the first [[Horse car|horse railway]] was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric [[tram]] was developed. 

In 1887 [[Emile Berliner]] invented the record and the [[phonograph|gramophone]]. 

The upswing in Hanover started with the era of urban Director [[Heinrich Tramm]]. From 1891–1918 he was director of the city of Hanover, and fundamentally shaped the look of the city up to the turn of the century (The "Tramm Era"). The New Town Hall, the Trammplatz, is named after him. 

In 1883 from the city of Hanover, the Hanover district government was created and became active. 

The city was enlarged first in 1869, followed in 1882 by adding Königsworther Platz and the Welfengarten. In 1891 the municipalities of [[Herrenhausen]], [[Hainholz]], [[Vahrenwald]] were added. In 1907 the municipalities of [[Herrenhausen-Stöcken|Stöcken]], Gutsbezirk Mecklenheide, Bothfeld, Klein-Buchholz, [[Groß-Buchholz]], [[Kirchrode]], [[Döhren-Wülfel|Döhren]] and [[Döhren-Wülfel|Wülfel]] were incorporated into Hanover

[[File:Hannover Synagogenmahnmal.jpg|thumb|left|The Synagogue Memorial in Hanover.]]
=== Nazi Germany ===
From 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the [[NSDAP]] (NAZI party). As everywhere else in Germany, there was also a [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish population in Hanover]]. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to [[Poland]], including the [[Herschel Grynszpan|Grynszpan family]]. However, Poland refused to admit them. The Grynszpans and thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees were left stranded at the border, fed only intermittently by the Polish [[Red Cross]] and Jewish welfare organizations. Their famous (or infamous) assassin son [[Herschel Grynszpan]] was in [[Paris]] at the time. When he heard about the expulsion of his family to Poland, he drove to the German embassy and killed the German diplomat Eduard [[Ernst vom Rath]]. 

The Nazis took this act as a pretext for staging their  nationwide pogrom known as [[Kristallnacht]]. It was in Hanover on November 9, 1938 that the synagogue, designed in 1870 by [[Edwin Oppler]] in [[neo-romantic]] style, was burnt by the Nazis. 

In September 1941, through the "Action Lauterbacher" plan, a [[ghettoisation]] of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began. Even before the [[Wannsee Conference]], on December 15, 1941, the first Jews from Hanover were deported to [[Riga]]. A total of 2,400 people were deported, and very few survived. Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover 1938, less than 100 were still in the city when troops of the [[United States Army]] arrived on April 10, 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war. Today, a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover.

=== World War II ===
[[File:Aegidienkirche Hannover.jpg|thumb|The [[:de:Aegidienkirche (Hannover)|Aegidienkirche]] was not rebuilt and its ruins were kept as a WWII memorial.]]
Hanover was an important [[road junction]] and production center that was a target area of the [[Strategic bombing during World War II]], including the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Oil Campaign]]. Targets included the [[VARTA|AFA]] ([[Herrenhausen|Stöcken]]), the [[Oil Campaign of World War II|Deurag-Nerag]] refinery ([[Misburg]]), the [[Continental AG|Continental]] plant ([[Vahrenwald]]), the United light metal works (VLW) in [[Ricklingen]] and [[Laatzen]], and in [[Linden-Limmer|Linden]], [[Oil Campaign of World War II#References|the Hanover/Limmer rubber reclamation plant]], the [[Hanomag]] factory, and [[NMH]].  [[Forced labor]]ers were used from the [[List of subcamps of Neuengamme|Hannover-Misburg subcamp]] of the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]]. The residential areas were also targeted and more than 6,000 people were killed in the Allied bombing raids. More than 90% of the city center was destroyed in 88 bombing raids<ref>[http://www.hannover.de/de/kultur_freizeit/geschichte/geschichte_/Stadt_Hannover/gesch_zah/gesch_za3.html| History of Hanover 1866-1945, official web site of the city (German)]</ref>. After the war, the [[:de:Aegidienkirche (Hannover)|Aegidienkirche]] was not rebuilt and its ruins were kept as a war memorial.

Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany after the war, and became part of the new [[länder|state (Land)]] of [[Lower Saxony]] in 1946.

Today the City of Hanover is a Vice-President City of [[Mayors for Peace]], an international Mayoral organization mobilizing cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by the year 2020.<ref>[http://www.2020visioncampaign.org Mayors for Peace]</ref>

One of the most famous sights is the ''[[Herrenhausen Gardens|Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen]]'':

The ''Great Garden'' is an important European baroque garden. The palace itself, however, was largely destroyed by Allied bombing. Some points of interest are the ''Grotto'' (the interior was designed by the French artist [[Niki de Saint-Phalle]]), the ''Galery Building'', the ''Orangerie'' and the two pavillons by Remy de la Fosse. The Great Garden consists of several parts. The most popular ones are the ''Great Ground'' and the ''Neuveau Jardin''. At the centre of the Neuveau Jardin is Europe's highest garden fountain. The historic ''Garden Theatre'' inter alia hosted the musicals of the German rock musician [[Heinz Rudolf Kunze]]. 

The ''Berggarten'' is an important European botanical garden. Some points of interest are the ''Tropical House'', the ''Cactus House'', the ''Canary House'' and the ''Orchid House'', which hosts one of the world's biggest collection of orchids, and free-flying birds and butterflies. Near the entrance to the Berggarten is the historic ''Library Pavillon''. The ''Mausoleum'' of the Guelphs is also located in the Berggarten. Like the Great Garden, the Berggarten also consists of several parts, for example the ''Paradies'' and the ''Prairie Garden''. There is also the ''[[Sea Life Centre]] Hanover'', which is the first tropical aquarium in Germany.

The ''[[Georgengarten]]'' is an English landscape garden.  The ''Leibniz Temple'' and the ''Georgen Palace'' are two points of interest there. 

Other gardens are the ''Guelph Garden'' with the ''Guelph Palace'' and the ''Prince Garden''. Nearby are the ''Water Art'', the ''Hardenbergsche House'' and the ''Prince House''.

The landmark of Hanover is the ''New Town Hall'' (Neues Rathaus).  Inside the building are four scale models of the town and the only working diagonal elevator in Germany, which goes up the large dome. 

The ''[[Hanover Zoo]]'' is one of the most spectacular and best zoos in Europe. The zoo received the Park Scout Award for the third year running in 2008, placing it among the best zoos in Germany. The zoo consists of several theme-areas: Sambesi, Meyers Farm, Gorilla-Mountain, Jungle-Palace, and Mullewapp.  Some smaller areas are Australia, the wooded area for wolves, and the so-called swimming area with many seabirds.  There is also a tropical house, a jungle house, and a show arena.  The new Alaska-themed area, Yukon Bay, is still under construction. 

Another point of interest is the ''Old Town''.  At the centre is the huge [[Marktkirche|Market Church]] and the ''Old Town Hall''.  Near by are the ''Leibniz House'', the ''Nolte House'', and the ''Beguine Tower''.  A very nice quarter of the Old Town is the ''Kreuz-Church-Quarter'' around the ''Kreuz Church'' with many nice little lanes. Nearby is the old theatre, called ''Ballhofeins''.  On the edge of the Old Town are the ''Market Hall'', the ''Leine Palace'', and the ruin of the ''Aegidien Church'' which is now a monument to the victims of war and violence. Through the ''Marstall Gate'' you arrive at the bank of the river ''Leine'', where the world-famous ''Nanas'' of [[Niki de Saint-Phalle]] are located. They are part of the ''Mile of Sculpture'' which leads from the Königsworter Square up to the entrance of the Georgengarten. Near the Old Town is the district Calenberger Neustadt where the Catholic Church of ''St. Clemens'', the ''Reformed Church'', and the Protestant ''Neustädter Church'' are located.    

Some other popular sights are the ''Waterloo Column'', the ''[[Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves|Laves]] House'', the ''Wangenheim Palace'', the ''Lower Saxony State Archives'', the ''Hanover Playhouse'', the ''Kröpcke Clock'', the ''Anzeiger Tower Block'', the ''Administration Building of the NORD/LB'', the ''Cupola Hall'' of the Congress Centre, the ''Lower Saxony Stock'', the ''Ministry of Finance'', the ''Garten Church'', the ''Luther Church'', the ''Gehry Tower'' (designed by the American architect [[Frank O. Gehry]]), the specially designed ''Bus Stops'', the ''Opera House'', ''the Central Station'', the ''Maschsee'' lake and the city forest ''Eilenriede'', which is one of the largest of its kind in Europe. Due to its around 40 parks, forests and gardens, a couple of lakes, two rivers and one canal, Hanover offers a large variety of leisure activities.

Since 2007 the historic ''Leibniz Letters'', which can be visited in the ''[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] Library'', are an UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].

Outside of the city centre is the ''EXPO-Park'', former site of [[EXPO 2000]]. Some points of interests are the ''Planet M.'', the former ''German Pavillon'', the ''Yempa Event-Palace'', the ''Expowale'', the ''EXPO-Plaza'' and the ''EXPO-Gardens'' (Parc Agricole, EXPO-Park South and the Gardens of change). Via the ''Exponale'', which is one of the largest pedestrianbridges in Europe, the fairground is reachable. The ''Hanover fairground'' is the largest in the world. Two important sights on the fairground are the ''Hermes Tower'' (88.8 metres high) and the ''EXPO Roof'', which is the largest woodroof in the world. 

In the district of Anderten is the ''European Cheese Centre'', which is the only Cheese-Experience-Centre in Europe. Nearby is also Hanovers large funpark, the ''CAMPO Aktiv-Arena''. It is the largest sports- and leisure facility in Northern Germany with around 60 attractions. Another important sight in Anderten is the ''Hindenburg Lock'', which was the biggest lock in Europe at the time of construction in 1928. The ''Animalgarden'' in the district of Kirchrode is a huge forest and shows the local animals. 

In the district of Groß-Buchholz is the ''Telemax'', the tallest building in Lower Saxony and one of the highest television towers in Northern Germany. Some other remarkable towers are the ''VW-Tower'' and the old towers of the former mid-age defence belt: ''Döhrener Tower'', ''Lister Tower'' and the ''Horse Tower''. 

The 36 most important sights of the city centre are connected with a {{convert|4.2|km|mi|0}} long red line, which is painted on the pavement. This so-called ''Red Thread'' marks out a walk that starts at the Tourist Information Office and ends on the Ernst-August-Square in front of the central station. There is also a guided sightseeing-bus tour through the city.
