'''Lake Baskunchak''' ({{lang-ru|Баскунчак}}) is a [[salt lake (geography)|salt lake]] of 115 km² in [[Astrakhan Oblast]], [[Russia]], located at {{coord|48|10|N|46|53|E}}, about 270 km north of the [[Caspian Sea]], and 53 km east of the [[Volga]]. Since 1997 the area is strictly protected as [[nature reserve]].

The surface elevation of the lake is 21 m below [[sea level]]. It is fed by a river that draws from an area of 11,000 km². The [[salinity]] of the lake is about 300 g/l. Since the 8th century its salt was mined and distributed via the [[Silk Road]]. Nowadays the lake's salt of distinct purity (99.8 % [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]]) covers 80 % of [[Russia]]'s salt production. Depending on need, about 1.5 million to 5 million tons of salt are mined per year.

To the south of the lake ''Mount Bolshoye Bogdo'' rises to 150 m above [[sea level]], forming the highest elevation in the [[Caspian Depression]]. The hill is pushed up about 1 mm per year by a [[salt dome]]. [[Sinkhole]]s, and [[Karst topography|Karst caves]] of up to 1.5 km length lead through the hill. It also is the only area in [[Europe]] where [[Triassic]] [[lagerstätte]]n surface. To the local [[Kalmyk people]], it is a holy hill.
