'''''Playing the Angel''''',  released on [[17 October]] [[2005]], is the eleventh full-length [[album]] by [[Depeche Mode]]. It was supported by the ''[[Touring the Angel]]'' tour.

The name "Playing the Angel" is taken from a lyric in the closing song "The Darkest Star". It is the fourth Depeche Mode album to get its name from a lyric in its album, the other three being ''[[Construction Time Again]]'', ''[[Some Great Reward]]'' and ''[[Black Celebration]]''. 

==Overview==
The album is the first of Depeche Mode's to feature [[Dave Gahan]] as co-writer: three of the tracks' ("Suffer Well", "I Want It All" and "Nothing's Impossible") lyrics were written by the singer, while [[Christian Eigner]] and Andrew Phillpott wrote the music on these. Gahan is the lead singer on all songs except for the instrumental "Introspectre", and [[Martin Gore]]-sung tracks "Macro" and "Damaged People". Gahan also sings backing vocals on "Macro", which was the first time he had sung backing on one of Gore's songs since ''Violator'''s "Sweetest Perfection".

The album has been called a more organic record for using more analog synths than digital ones.  In addition, most of the soundscapes presented are harsher and groovier than the more mellow ''[[Exciter (album)|Exciter]]''.

In mid-July 2005, the unfinished video for "Precious" was leaked [[online]]. It is believed to have been leaked through the website of the production team that helped make the video.

Tracks recorded during the ''Playing the Angel'' sessions that did not make the album include "[[Martyr (song)|Martyr]]", which was originally planned to be the lead single but was eventually deemed too poppy for the album and saved for their new ''[[The Best Of, Volume 1]]'' album.  Other songs include "Free," which ended up on the "[[Precious (Depeche Mode song)|Precious]]" single and the [[Japan]]ese version of ''Playing the Angel.''

The album was released as a standard [[CD]] and a deluxe [[Super Audio CD|SACD]]/[[DVD]] version (CD/DVD version in the [[United States|U.S.]]) which includes the album on hybrid multi-channel SACD as the main disc and a bonus [[DVD]] featuring an exclusive studio performance of "Clean" (from ''[[Violator (album)|Violator]]''), the video for "Precious," a photo gallery and a 5.1 mix of the album. There's also a documentary on the making of the album. All ten of the earlier Depeche Mode albums were re-released in similar format to ''Playing the Angel'', a CD/SACD hybrid (in the US simply a remastered CD) with a DVD featuring a 5.1 mix of each album and a documentary, though ''Playing the Angel'''s documentary is far less extensive and also shorter than the classic ones.

The [[iTunes]] deluxe edition of the album has several bonuses, including another "bare" version of a ''Violator'' track — "Waiting for the Night", and the music video for "Precious". People who placed the album on [[pre-order (iTunes)|pre-order]] were [[pre-order bonus|eligible]] to participate in a ticket pre-sale for most ''Touring the Angel'' concerts – the first time such an offer was made by iTunes and [[Ticketmaster]].

In the UK the album debuted at #6, and in the U.S. it debuted at #7 with sales of 98,000 copies.<ref>Whitmire, Margo. [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001390218 "Simpson Strikes Back: Ashlee Scores 2nd No. 1"]. [[billboard.com]]. October 26, 2005.</ref> Both are improvements on the band's previous effort, ''[[Exciter]]'', which charted at #9 and #8, respectively.  With worldwide sales of 3.6 mil. copies, ''Playing the Angel'' is Mute Records' best selling album in the 2000s.

==Reaction==

Reviews have been mostly strong for ''Playing the Angel''. [[E! Online]] and [[Entertainment Weekly]] gave the album high scores. [[Indie (music)|Indie]] music website [[Pitchforkmedia|Pitchfork Media]] gave the album a positive review but criticized its lack of innovation.  There are some negative reviews however - ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, historically unfriendly to Depeche Mode albums, gave the album a 2.5 out of 5, lower than what ''[[Exciter (album)|Exciter]]'' received.

The album was #20 on E! Online's top 20 albums of 2005 list and #68 on [http://www.woxy.com Woxy 97.7]'s top 97 albums of 2005.

The album is considered by numerous fans to be [[Loudness war#Popular Examples|poorly mastered]] [http://brianstagg.co.uk/p_t_a_clipressed/] [http://www.sharoma.com/trading/loudness.htm], relying on heavy compression to intentionally and artificially boost the output. Due to the format's inherent characteristics, vinyl versions are unaffected by the perceived poor mastering of the CD versions.

==Album art==
The character on the album cover is a little creature called "Tubby Goth" (by the band) and "Mister Feathers" (by the label, the webmaster and the fans.)  The cover design by Anton Corbijn is a tip of the hat to a famous still photograph of [[The Cure]]'s Robert Smith circa "[[Boys Don't Cry (song)|Boys Don't Cry]]".

<!--[[Image:Boysdontcry86.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of [[The Cure]]'s "[[Boys Don't Cry_(song)|Boys Don't Cry]]" rereleased single of 1986, the subject of the April Fool's joke.]] NOTE: I think the inclusion of this image on this page violates the fair use policy, so I've commented it out, feel free to delete it entirely if you're sure it does -->
