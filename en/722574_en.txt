{{redirect|Daina}}
A '''daina''' is a traditional form of [[music]] or [[poetry]] from [[Latvia]]. Lithuanian [[Daina (Lithuania)|dainas]] share common traits. Latvian dainas often feature pre-Christian themes and legends, [[drone (music)|drone]] vocal styles and Baltic [[zither]]s ([[kokle]]).

Dainas are very short, usually only one or two unrhymed [[stanza]]s, unrhymed and in a four-footed [[trochaic]] metre.  Lyrically, dainas concern themselves with native mythology but, in contrast to most similar forms, do not have any legendary [[hero]]es.  Stories often revolve around pre-Christian deities like the [[solar deity|sun goddess]] [[Saule]], the [[lunar deity|moon god]] [[Meness]] and, most notably, the life of people, especially its three most important events - birth, wedding and death (including burial).  The first collection of dainas was published between 1894 and 1915 as ''[[Latvju Dainas]]'' by [[Krisjanis Barons|Krišjānis Barons]]. There are well over two hundred thousand collected dainas in written form.
