'''McFly''' are a [[BRIT Award]] winning [[pop rock]] band who first found fame in 2004.

==History==
=== ''Formation'' ===
[[Image:McFly Jones iTunes.jpg|thumb|right|Guitarist [[Danny Jones]] met [[Tom Fletcher]] at auditions for [[V (band)|V]].]]
McFly was founded and named by frontman [[Tom Fletcher]], after he auditioned for [[Busted (band)|Busted]]<ref name="beatsbar">{{cite web |url=http://www.thebeatsbar.co.uk/ccinterviews/mcfly.html |title=McFly Interview by CMU's Chris Cooke |month=December | year=2005|accessdate=2007-11-23| work=[http://www.thebeatsbar.co.uk CMU Beats Bar]}}</ref> but lost out on the place to [[Charlie Simpson]] (who later went on to co-found [[post-hardcore]] band [[Fightstar]]). Originally, Fletcher was accepted as part of [[Busted]]'s line-up; however, the [[Island Records|Island]] record label went on to reassess the situation, eventually deciding to have the band as a threesome rather than a foursome. Fletcher states that he was in the band "for approximately 24 hours."<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21jv5-csFPY&feature=related</ref> Though the record label decided against offering Fletcher a place in Busted, they were intrigued by his song-writings talents, and later offered him a place on the Busted songwriting 'team', alongside band member (and already accomplished songwriter) [[James Bourne]]; Fletcher has since stated that it was Bourne who taught him how to "properly" structure songs, and how to "come up with good, poppy melodies".{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

During the writing project for [[Busted]]'s second album, ''[[A Present For Everyone]]'', Fletcher was asked by the record label if he was available to film auditions for a new band, [[V (band)|V]]. It was at this time that [[Danny Jones]] and Fletcher met for the first time; Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be an instrumental band, rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing boy band, for which they were intended.<ref name="Guardian04">{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,1266615,00.html |title=Mad about the boys |author=Alexis Petridis |accessdate=2007-11-23 |date=2004-07-23 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Fletcher was impressed with Jones's unique style, and so approached and invited him to write with himself and [[James Bourne|Bourne]]. When writing projects for Busted had come to an end, the two began collaborating for their own (as of yet, unnamed) band, and, eventually, moved into the [[InterContinental|InterContinental Hotel]] in London for two months,(whilst still receiving help from Bourne)<ref name="RTTFofic">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcflyofficial.com/news/index.php?id=310 |title=Debut McFly album track by track |accessdate=2007-11-23 |work=[http://www.mcflyofficial.com McFlyOfficial.com]}}</ref> to concentrate on writing together. Bassist [[Dougie Poynter]] and drummer [[Harry Judd]] were subsequently recruited via a classified advertisement in the ''[[NME]]'' magazine.<ref name="beatsbar"/> Both Essex lads, the pair turned up, coincidentally, at the same audition, and got to talking over their shared appreciation of the band [[The Starting Line]], after [[Dougie Poynter|Poynter]] noticed their name and logo was printed on Judd's t shirt. The name McFly was eventually decided upon as the band name.  Fletcher proposed the idea, based on his love for the American science-fiction comedy [[Back to the Future trilogy|''Back to the Future'' trilogy]] and [[Michael J. Fox]]'s character [[Marty McFly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilikemusic.com/interviews/-684 |title=McFly - Harry chats to ilikemusic.com|work=[http://www.ilikemusic.com ilikemusic.com]|accessdate=2007-11-23|month=September | year=2004}}</ref>

=== ''Room on the 3rd Floor'' ===
McFly's early sound was pop music. Their debut single, "[[5 Colours in Her Hair]]", released 29 March 2004, entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at [[Hit record| number 1]] in April 2004 and stayed there the following week.<ref name="T40-5C">{{cite web|url=http://acharts.us/song/1509 |title=McFly  5 Colours In Her Hair Music charts|accessdate=2008-12-11}}</ref> In July 2004 their second single, "[[Obviously]]", also topped the charts.<ref name="T40-O">{{cite web|url=http://acharts.us/song/1617|title=McFly  Obviously Music charts|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> This was followed by the album ''[[Room on the 3rd Floor]]'' debuting at number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="Guardian04"/> It would go on to be certified [[Music recording sales certification|double platinum]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry]].<ref name="BPI-RTTF"/> The album broke records, as McFly earned an award from [[Guinness World Records]] for being the youngest band to have a debut album enter the charts in the top position, a distinction previously held by [[The Beatles]].<ref name="ilike"/> The idea for the album name came from where Jones and Fletcher wrote most of the songs for the album: room 363 in the InterContinental Hotel in London.<ref name="RTTFofic"/> The third single, "[[That Girl (McFly song)|That Girl]]", was released on 6 September 2004, placing at number 3.<ref name="ChartStatsThatGirl">{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=331 |title=Chart Stats - McFly - That Girl|work=[http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=331 McFly - That Girl]|accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> The fourth single, [[Room on the 3rd Floor (song)|Room on the 3rd Floor]], the album's title track, was released on 15 November 2004 and reached number 5.<ref name="RTTFS5">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcflyofficial.com/news/index.php?id=542 |title=No.5 - Thanks |work=[http://www.mcflyofficial.com McFlyOfficial.com]|date=2004-12-21|accessdate=2007-11-23}}</ref> McFly supported Busted on their nationwide arena tour<ref name="Guardian04"/> along with V in February 2004 and then had their first headlining tour in September 2004.<ref name="RTTF Tour"/>
