'''Hiiu County''' ({{lang-et|Hiiu maakond}}), or '''''Hiiumaa''''', is one of 15 [[Counties of Estonia|counties]] of [[Estonia]], being the smallest county both in terms of area and population. It consists of [[Hiiumaa]] ([[German language|German]], {{lang-sv|Dagö}}), the second largest [[island]] of Estonia, and several smaller islands near it. The county borders [[Lääne County]] to the east and [[Saare County]] to the south. 10,097 people live in Hiiu County – constituting 0.8% of the total population in Estonia (as of January 2009).<ref name="County_population">{{cite web|url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=PO0222&path=../I_Databas/Population/01Population_indicators_and_composition/04Population_figure_and_composition/&lang=1|title=Population by sex, ethnic nationality and County, 1 January|date=1 January 2009|work=stat.ee|publisher=Statistics Estonia|accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

== History ==
Human habitation of Hiiumaa can be traced back to the 5th millennium BC. [[Mesolithic]] sites in Kõpu peninsula are presented by the seal-hunters' settlements. There are several well preserved grave fields of the [[Iron Age]]. In 1228, the island was first mentioned in written annals under the name ''Dageida''. In 1254, Hiiumaa was divided between the [[Livonian Order]] and the [[Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek]]. In 1563 Hiiumaa was annexed into [[Sweden]]. In 1710, as a result of the [[Great Northern War]] the island went under the control of the [[Russian Empire]]. During [[World War I]], the German military forces occupied Hiiumaa in 1917. In 1918–1940 Hiiumaa was part of the Republic of Estonia, then until 1991 occupied by the [[Soviet Union]].

On demands of the [[Hanseatic League]] a lighthouse was built in [[Kõpu]] in the beginning of sixteenth century (previously known as ''Dagerort''). It is considered the third oldest continuously operating lighthouse in the whole world, still showing its light to 35 miles to the sea. 

The best part of the farm architecture comes from the XIX century. Examples are Mihkli farming complex and Soera farm-museum with all the old national artefacts.
