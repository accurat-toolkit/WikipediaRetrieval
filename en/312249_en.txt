'''Bryophytes''' have tissues and enclosed reproductive systems, but they lack [[vascular tissue]] that circulates liquids.<ref name="urlWhat are Bryophytes">{{cite web |url=http://bryophytes.plant.siu.edu/bryojustified.html |title=What are Bryophytes |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref>  They neither have [[flowers]] nor produce [[seed]]s, reproducing via [[spore]]s.  The term ''bryophyte'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''βρύον'' - ''bryon'', "tree-moss, oyster-green"  + ''φυτόν'' - ''fyton'' "plant".

The bryophytes (or non-tracheophytes) do not form a [[monophyletic group]]<ref name="pmid18205621">{{cite journal |author=Troitsky AV, Ignatov MS, Bobrova VK, Milyutina IA |title=Contribution of genosystematics to current concepts of phylogeny and classification of bryophytes |journal=Biochemistry Mosc. |volume=72 |issue=12 |pages=1368–76 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18205621 |doi= |url=http://protein.bio.msu.ru/biokhimiya/contents/v72/full/72121675.html}}</ref> but consist of three groups, the [[Marchantiophyta]] (liverworts), [[Anthocerotophyta]] (hornworts), and [[moss|Bryophyta]] (mosses).<ref name="urlGLOSSARY B">{{cite web |url=http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookglossB.html |title=GLOSSARY B |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> Originally the three groups were brought together as the three classes of division '''Bryophyta'''.  However, since the three groups of bryophytes form a  [[paraphyletic]] group, they now are placed in three separate divisions.

[[Image:Bryo_cladogram.jpg|thumb|556px|center|Two hypotheses on the phylogeny of land plants (embryophyta).]]
Modern studies of the land plants generally show one of two patterns. 
* In one of these patterns, the liverworts were the first to diverge, followed by the hornworts, while the mosses are the closest living relatives of the [[Polysporangiophyte|polysporangiates]] (which include the [[vascular plant]]s).<ref name="pmid17030812">{{cite journal |author=Qiu YL, Li L, Wang B, ''et al.'' |title=The deepest divergences in land plants inferred from phylogenomic evidence |journal=Proc.

== Bryophyte sexuality ==

These plants are generally [[gametophyte]]-oriented; that is, the normal plant is the [[haploid]] gametophyte,<ref name="urlBryophytes - introduction">{{cite web |url=http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/FPAS/bcs/bl14apl/bryo1.htm |title=Bryophytes - introduction |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref> with the only [[diploid]] structure being the [[sporangium]] in season. As a result, bryophyte sexuality is very different from that of other plants.  There are two basic categories of sexuality in bryophytes:

* [[Dioicous]] bryophytes produce only [[antheridium|antheridia]] (male organs) or [[archegonium|archegonia]] (female organs) on a single plant body.
* [[Monoicous]] bryophytes produce both [[antheridium|antheridia]] and [[archegonium|archegonia]] on the same plant body.

Some bryophyte species may be either monoicous or dioicous depending on environmental conditions.  Other species grow exclusively with one type of sexuality.

Notice that  these terms are ''not'' the same as '''monoecious''' and '''dioecious''', which refer to whether or not a [[sporophyte]] plant bears one or both kinds of gametophyte.  Those terms apply only to [[Spermatophyte|seed plants]].

==Bryophyte life cycle==
Dispersal in bryophytes is via [[spore]]s; they neither have [[flowers]] nor produce [[seed]]s. Bryophytes do produce gametes that fuse to form a zygote, which in turn develops into an embryo, but this is not contained in a seed as in gymnosperms and angiosperms.
