A '''vegetable''' is an [[eating|edible]] plant or part of a [[plant]]. However, the word is not [[science|scientific]], and its meaning is largely based on [[culinary art|culinary]] and [[culture|cultural]] tradition. Therefore the application of the word is somewhat arbitrary and subjective.  For example, some people consider [[mushroom]]s to be vegetables,<ref>"Mushrooms" classified under "Other vegetables".

==Fruit or vegetable?==
[[Image:Fruitnveg-3.png|thumb|300px|An [[Euler diagram]] showing the overlaps between "fruits" and "vegetables" in the informal (culinary) sense, and "fruits" in the botanical sense.]]

In everyday (non-technical) language, the words "[[fruit]]" and "vegetable" are mutually exclusive: plant products that are called fruits are hardly ever classified as vegetables, and vice versa.   However, for scientists the word "fruit" also has a precise [[botany|botanical]] meaning, which is considerably different from its common meaning.  While [[peach]]es, [[plum]]s, and [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] are "fruits" in both senses, many items commonly called "vegetables" — such as [[eggplant]]s, [[bell pepper]]s, and [[tomato]]es — are technically fruits, as are also most [[cereal]]s, as well as some spices like [[pepper]] and [[chiles]]. On the other hand, many items commonly called "fruits" — including [[fig]]s, [[pineapple]]s, and [[Garden strawberry|strawberries]] — are not fruits in the strict botanical sense.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The question of whether the tomato is a fruit or a vegetable found its way into the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1893. The court ruled unanimously in ''[[Nix v. Hedden]]'' that a [[tomato]] is correctly identified as, and thus taxed as, a vegetable, for the purposes of the 1883 Tariff Act on imported produce. The court did acknowledge, however, that, botanically speaking, a tomato is a fruit.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=149&invol=304 Full text of the opinion in Nix v. Hedden courtesy of Findlaw.com.]</ref>

Languages other than [[English language|English]] often have categories that can be identified with the common English meanings of "fruit" and "vegetable", but their precise meaning often depends on local culinary traditions.  For example, in [[Brazil]] the [[avocado]] is traditionally consumed with sugar as a dessert or in milk shakes, and hence it is regarded as a fruit, whereas in other countries (including [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]]) it is used in salads and dips, and hence considered a vegetable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Some vegetables defined as different parts of plants==

**  ''[[Legumes]]'': [[green bean]]s, [[snap pea]]s, [[soybean]]

==Etymology==
[[Image:Légumes 01.jpg|thumb|Vegetables in market.]]
"Vegetable" comes from the Latin ''vegetabilis'' (animated) and from ''vegetare'' (enliven), which is derived from ''vegetus'' (active), in reference to the process of a plant growing. This in turn derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] base ''*weg-'' or ''*wog-'', which is also the source of the English ''wake'', meaning "become (or stay) alert".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The word "vegetable" was first recorded in [[English language|English]] in the [[14th century]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} but applied to any plant. The word is still used in science with that meaning (e.g., ''vegetable matter'', ''vegetable kingdom'').<ref name="swedenborg">Swedenborg, Emanuel (2003). ''Swedenborg Concordance 1888''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 502. ISBN 0-7661-3728-7.</ref>  The meaning of "vegetable" as "plant grown for [[food]]" was not established until the [[18th century]].<ref>{{cite book | first=John | last=Ayto | title=Dictionary of Word Origins | publisher=Arcade Publishing | location=New York | year=1993 | isbn=1-55970-214-1 | oclc=33022699}}</ref>

==Nutrition==
[[Image:Stir Fry.JPG|thumb|South Asian style stir fry [[ipomoea aquatica]] in chili and [[sambal]]]]
Vegetables are eaten in a variety of ways, as part of [[meal|main meals]] and as [[snack food|snacks]]. The [[nutrition]]al content of vegetables varies considerably, though generally they contain little [[protein]] or [[fat]],<ref>

</ref> and varying proportions of [[vitamin]]s, [[provitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral]]s, [[dietary fiber|fiber]] and [[carbohydrates]].  Vegetables contain a great variety of other [[phytochemical]]s, some of which have been claimed to have [[antioxidant]], [[antiseptic|antibacterial]], [[antifungal drug|antifungal]], [[antiviral drug|antiviral]] and [[anticarcinogenic]] properties.<ref>

However, vegetables often also contain [[toxins]] and [[antinutrient]]s such as [[solanine|α-solanine]], [[chaconine|α-chaconine]]<ref>
  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6R-4HC6M43-2&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=d3ccd0379f35af56c40b194d580f75c4
</ref>, [[enzyme inhibitor]]s (of [[cholinesterase]], [[protease]], [[amylase]], etc.), [[cyanide]] and [[linamarin|cyanide precursors]], [[oxalic acid]], and more.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Depending on the concentration, such compounds may reduce the edibility, nutritional value, and health benefits of dietary vegetables.  Cooking and/or other processing may be necessary to eliminate or reduce them.

==Color pigments==
[[Image:GntVegCart.jpg|thumb|Vegetables (and some fruit) for sale on a street in [[Guntur]], [[India]]]]
The [[green]] [[color]] of leafy vegetables is due to the presence of the green [[pigment]] [[chlorophyll]]. Chlorophyll is affected by [[pH]] and changes to olive green in [[acid]] conditions, and bright green in [[alkaline]] conditions. Some of the acids are released in [[Steaming|steam]] during [[cooking]], particularly if cooked without a cover.

The [[yellow]]/[[Orange (colour)|orange]] colors of fruits and vegetables are due to the presence of [[carotenoids]], which are also affected by normal cooking processes or changes in pH.

The [[red]]/[[blue]] coloring of some fruits and vegetables (e.g. [[blackberries]] and [[red cabbage]]) are due to [[anthocyanins]], which are sensitive to changes in pH. When pH is neutral, the pigments are [[purple]], when acidic, red, and when alkaline, blue. These pigments are very water soluble.

==Safety==
[[File:Chholay.JPG|thumb|right|Pulse seeds.]]
For [[food safety]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] recommends proper fruit handling and preparation to reduce the risk of [[food contamination]] and [[foodborne illness]]. Fresh fruits and vegetables should be carefully selected. At the store, they should not be damaged or bruised and pre-cut pieces should be refrigerated or surrounded by ice. All fruits and vegetables should be rinsed before eating. This recommendation also applies to produce with rinds or skins that are not eaten. It should be done just before preparing or eating to avoid premature spoilage. Fruits and vegetables should be kept separate from raw foods like meat, poultry, and seafood, as well as any cooking utensils or surfaces that may have come into contact with them (e.g. cutting boards). Fruits and vegetables, if they are not going to be cooked, should be thrown away if they have touched raw meat, poultry, seafood or eggs. All cut, peeled, or cooked fruits and vegetables should be refrigerated within 2 hours. After a certain time, harmful bacteria may grow on them and increase the risk of foodborne illness. <ref name=cdc>[http://www.fruitsandveggiesmatter.gov/health_professionals/food_safety.html Food Safety Basics for Fruits and Vegetables] at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]</ref>

==Storage==
Proper Post Harvest Storage aimed at extending and ensuring shelf life is best affected by efficient [[cold chain]] application. All vegetables benefit from proper post harvest care<ref name=pxk>Why Cold Chain for Vegetables: {{cite web | first = Pawanexh | last = Kohli | year= 2008 | title = Fruits and Vegetables Post-Harvest Care: The Basics | url = http://crosstree.info/Documents/Care%20of%20F%20n%20V.pdf | publisher = Crosstree Techno-visors }}</ref>

Many [[root vegetable|root]] and non-root vegetables that grow underground can be stored through winter in a [[root cellar]] or other similarly cool, dark and dry place to prevent [[mold]], [[Potato#Toxic compounds in potatoes|greening]] and [[sprouting]]. Care should be taken in understanding the properties and vulnerabilities of the particular roots to be stored.  These vegetables can last through to early spring and be nearly as [[Nutrition|nutritious]] as when [[Post harvest freshness|fresh]]. 

During storage, leafy vegetables lose [[moisture]], and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly.  They should be stored for as short a time as possible in a cool place, in a container or [[plastic bag]].

== Standards ==
There are a series{{Which?|date=September 2009}} of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards regarding fruits and vegetables.<ref name="fvdp">{{cite web
