'''Marat Mikhailovich Safin''' ({{lang-tt|Марат Мөбин улы Сафин, Marat Möbin ulı Safin}} {{IPA-all|mɑˈrɑt ˈsɑfɪn|}}; {{lang-ru|Мара́т Миха́йлович (Муби́нович) Са́фин}}; born January 27, 1980, in [[Moscow]]) is a former World No. 1 Russian ATP tennis player.  He is the older brother of current World No. 1 [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] player [[Dinara Safina]]. They are the first brother-sister tandem in tennis history to both achieve No. 1 rankings.<ref name="When Winning is All in the Family">{{cite news |first=Clarey |last=Christopher |authorlink= |title=When Winning is All in the Family |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/18/sports/othersports/18iht-arena.html?_r=1&scp=25&sq=marat%20safin&st=cse |work= |publisher=''New York Times'' |date=[[2009-04-17]] |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref><ref name="Dinara Safina Clinches Top Spot In Women's Tennis Rankings">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Dinara Safina Clinches Top Spot In Women's Tennis Rankings |url=http://www.india-server.com/news/dinara-safina-clinches-top-spot-in-6975.html |work= |publisher=''India Server'' |date=[[2009-04-21]] |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref>

Safin began his professional career in 1997, and held the No. 1 world ranking for a total of 9 weeks between November 2000 and April 2001. He won his first Grand Slam title at the [[2000 U.S. Open (tennis)|2000 U.S. Open]] after defeating [[Pete Sampras]], and won the [[2005 Australian Open]], defeating Australian [[Lleyton Hewitt]] in the final. Safin helped lead [[Russia Davis Cup team|Russia]] to [[Davis Cup]] victories in 2002 and 2006. Despite his dislike of grass courts, he became the first Russian man to reach the semifinals of Wimbledon at the [[2008 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Singles|2008 Wimbledon Championships]]. At the time of his final Grand Slam appearance<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/8234576.stm Safin bows out of final US Open]</ref> at the [[2009 US Open - Men's Singles|US Open]] on 2 September 2009, Safin was No. 61 in the official world men's tennis rankings.

==Early life==
Safin was born in Moscow, [[USSR]] (now Russia), to Mikhail Alexeivich (Mubin Aliamtsevich) Safin and [[Rauza Islanova]], an ethnic [[Tatar]] family. Safin describes himself as a non-practicing [[Muslim]].<ref name="2003 pacific life open">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=An Interview With Marat Safin |url=http://www.futuretennisstars.com/interview399.html |work= |publisher=''Future Tennis Stars'' |date=[[2003-03-12]] |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref> He speaks Russian, English, and Spanish.

Safin's father managed the local [[Spartak Tennis Club]], where Safin trained in his youth alongside several tennis players, including [[Anna Kournikova]], [[Elena Dementieva]], and [[Anastasia Myskina]].

At age 14 he moved to [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], Spain, to gain access to advanced tennis training programs which were not available in Russia.<ref name="green">{{cite news |first=John |last=Roberts |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Why Safin looks green on grass |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/why-safin-looks-green-on-grass-675407.html |work= |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=2001-06-25 |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref> Safin says he grew up "very fast ... with no muscles" and that he moved to Spain because clay courts were "better for the knees".<ref name="green" /> Safin speaks fluent Spanish as a result.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/tennis/french_open/2030449.stm Safin joins Spanish party]</ref>

==Tennis career==
Safin started his professional career in 1997. In 1998, Safin consecutively defeated [[Andre Agassi]] and defending champion [[Gustavo Kuerten]] at the [[French Open]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E1DF1F3FF937A3575AC0A96E958260 U.S. OPEN: NOTEBOOK; After Teen-Agers Play, Talk Is of Top 10 Futures]</ref>

===World No. 1 and Grand Slam history===
Safin held the No. 1 [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] ranking for 9 weeks during 2000 when he won his first [[Grand Slam in tennis|Grand Slam]] tournament at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], becoming the only Russian in history to win this tournament in the Mens Singles draw, by defeating Pete Sampras in straight sets.<ref name="emotions" /> However, a succession of injuries hindered his progress and Safin missed the majority of the season in 2003 as a result.<ref>{{cite news |first=Karen |last=Lyon |authorlink= |title=Safin out with sore wrist |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/18/1042520821698.html |work= |publisher=''[[The Age]]'' |date=2003-01-19 |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref>

Safin reached the final round in three more Grand Slam tournaments, all in the [[Australian Open]] in 2002, 2004, and 2005. He has cited nervousness as the reason for his loss in the 2002 event, and physical exhaustion for the 2004 loss.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/aus/2004-02-01-men-final_x.htm Federer toys with Safin in Australian Open final]</ref> He defeated home-country favorite Lleyton Hewitt in the 2005 finals to secure his second Grand Slam in five years.

His best result at Wimbledon is reaching the semifinals  in 2008 often losing in the first or second rounds in other years.

===Masters Series===
Safin has won five ATP Tennis Masters Series titles during his career. His first was in 2000 when he won the title in Toronto, Canada. He holds a record-tying three (2000, 2002, and 2004) wins in Paris, France, and one in 2004 in [[Madrid]], Spain.

===Tennis Masters Cup===
In 2004, Safin reached the semifinal of the Tennis Masters Cup in [[Houston]], where he was defeated by Roger Federer, 6–3, 7–6 (18). The second-set tiebreak (20–18) was the third-longest tiebreak in the Open Era. Safin also reached the semifinals in 2000.

===Davis Cup===
Safin helped Russia achieve its first Davis Cup victory in 2002, with a 3–2 tie-breaking win against France in the final round at the Palais Omnisports Paris Bercy. His Russian team included [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]], [[Mikhail Youzhny]], [[Andrei Stoliarov]], and team captain
[[Shamil Tarpischev]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Alvanipour |authorlink= |title=Safin Gets Serious – Almost |url=http://www.tennis.com/backcourt/general/backcourt.aspx?id=54826 |work= |publisher=''[[Tennis magazine]]'' |date=2007-01-11 |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref> The team made Davis Cup history by being the second to win the event after losing the doubles tie-breaker, and becoming the first team to win a (live-televised) five-set finals match by coming back from a two-set deficit.
Safin also helped Russia to win the Davis Cup in 2006. After a straight sets defeat by [[David Nalbandian]] in his first match, his doubles victory (partnering [[Dmitry Tursunov]]) against Nalbandian and [[Agustín Calleri]] and singles victory against [[José Acasuso]] drove Russia to victory.

Heavily favored Russia was hosted by [[Israel Davis Cup team|Israel]] in a [[2009 Davis Cup World Group#Israel vs. Russia|Davis Cup quarterfinal tie]] in July 2009, on indoor hard courts at the Nokia Arena in [[Tel Aviv]].  Russia had won the Davis Cup in both 2002 and 2006, and was the top-ranked country in Davis Cup standings.<ref>[http://www.russiatoday.com/Top_News/2009-07-10/Israel_drops_Russia_2-0_in_Davis_Cup.html "Israel drops Russia 2-0 in Davis Cup," ''[[Russia Today]]'', 7/10/09, accessed 7/11/09]</ref>  The stage was set by Safin, who prior to the tie told the press:  "With all due respect, Israel was lucky to get to the quarterfinals."<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1099339.html Spungin, Simon, "Davis Cup win was a very Israeli triumph," ''[[Haaretz]]'', 7/11/09, accessed 7/11/09]</ref>  The Israeli team then beat the Russian team in each of their first three matches.  [[Harel Levy]] (world # 210) beat Andreev (world # 24), and  [[Dudi Sela]] (# 33) followed by beating Youzhny.  The next day Israelis [[Andy Ram]] and [[Jonathan Erlich]] beat Safin and doubles specialist Kunitsyn 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 4-6, 6-4 in front of a boisterous crowd of over 10,000.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443776842&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull "Netanyahu: Davis Cup team has filled nation with pride," ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 7/11/09, accessed 7/11/09]</ref>  With the tie clinched for Israel, the reverse singles rubbers were "[[Dead rubber|dead]]", and instead of best-of-five matches, best-of-three sets were played, with the outcomes of little to no importance.<ref>[http://www.tennistalk.com/en/news/20090711/Singles_rubbers_dead_as_Israel_finishes_off_Russia Dimon, Ricky, "Singles rubbers dead as Israel finishes off Russia," ''Tennis Talk'', 7/11/09, accessed 7/11/09]</ref>  Israel wrapped up a 4-1 victory over Russia, splitting the final matches.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/tennis/story/1138485.html "Israel completes Davis Cup win over Russia," ''Miami Herald'', 7/12/09/accessed 7/12/09]</ref>

===2005===
[[File:2006 04 11 safin.jpg|thumb|Safin Has one of the most devastating backhands on the tour]]
The 2005 Australian Open was considered one of the most inspiring Grand Slams in the history of mens tennis by a lot of tennis critics, in which Safin had to beat the very best beating Roger Federer in the semi-Final 5-7, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (8-6), 9-7 with Safin saving a match point late in the fourth set, and then going on to make the final and beating homeboy Lleyton Hewitt 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 in inspiring fashion. Safin attributed his recent revival and more consistent performance to the calming presence of his new coach [[Peter Lundgren]], saying that "I never believed in myself before at all, until I started to work with him." Lundgren had been Federer's coach, until parting ways at the end of 2003; Safin hired Lundgren the following year. He was later defeated in the early rounds of each of the seven tournaments he played between the Australian Open and the French Open. In June 2005, shortly after his unsuccessful French Open campaign, Safin made a surprise finals appearance at the Wimbledon tune-up tournament in [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Halle]] on grass. He lost the final narrowly to the defending champion, Roger Federer.

===2006===
[[File:Safin at the Nasdaq 100 Open (2006).jpg|thumb|Safin at the Nasdaq 100 Open 2006]]
Although a serious knee-injury hampered Safin's progression and rankings within the ATP (he missed the 2005 US Open, 2005 Tennis Masters Cup and 2006 Australian Open), Safin made appearances at the 2006 ATP Masters tournaments at Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome and Hamburg.

On August 17, 2006, after a disappointing year during which Safin suffered injuries and his ranking plummeted to as low as 104, Safin temporarily parted ways with coach Peter Lundgren.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/5260596.stm Safin to take a break from coach]</ref>

At the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|2006 US Open]], Safin defeated David Nalbandian, who was then World #4, in the 2nd Round in a 5th Set tiebreaker, but lost at the 4th Round to former world #2 [[Tommy Haas]], also on a 5th set tiebreaker.

Safin helped Russia beat the USA 3–2 to gain a place in the finals in December 2006, and secondly with a good run at the start of the indoor season the Thailand Open where he was narrowly edged out by #7 seed, [[James Blake]].

On October 14, 2006, Safin made it to his first final in a year-and-a-half at the [[Kremlin Cup]] in Moscow, the first all Russian final at that event, losing to [[Nikolay Davydenko]].

On December 3, 2006, Safin defeated José Acasuso 6–3, 3–6, 6–3, 7–6 (5) in the 5th rubber of the [[2006 Davis Cup]], winning the cup for Russia. He had previously lost 6–4, 6–4, 6–4 to David Nalbandian in his first match. In the doubles match, he teamed with Dmitry Tursunov to win against Nalbandian and Agustín Calleri in straight sets.

===2007===
[[Image:Marat Safin 2007 US Open.jpg|thumb|Safin practicing at the 2007 US Open]]
Safin did not play any warm-up tournaments in the run up to the [[Australian Open]].  As Safin was forced to miss the tournament in 2006 due to injury, 2007 was his first Australian Open since he captured the title in 2005. Safin lost against sixth seed Andy Roddick in the third round match by 6–7, 6–2, 4–6, 6–7 in a grueling 3-hour match. Roddick commented after the match, "With Marat you know you are going to get an emotional roller-coaster.

Safin's next tournament was in Valencia. He defeated former World No. 1 and number 4 seed [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]] 6–3, 5–7, 6–4. In spite of the fact that Ferrero is from the Valencia region, Safin was the more popular player, having been based in Valencia for many years and being a well-known [[Valencia CF]] fan<ref>[http://www.somosche.com/famosos_del_valencia-itemap-83-16551-13.htm  Somosche.com]</ref> - local player Ferrero controversially favouring [[Real Madrid]].<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/versatile-ferrero-shows-real-class-to-reach-last-eight-720534.html Versatile Ferrero shows real class to reach the last eight], ''The Independent'', 21 Apr 2000, accessed 30 Sept 2009.</ref> He played Dutch teenager [[Robin Haase]] in the next round.
