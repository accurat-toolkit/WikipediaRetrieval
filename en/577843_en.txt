Excerpt: “We should distinguish two complementary ways in which the advent of the Turks affected the language map of Iran. First, since the Turkish-speaking rulers of most Iranian polities from the Ghaznavids and Seljuks onward were already iranized and patronized Persian literature in their domains, the expansion of Turk-ruled empires served to expand the territorial domain of written Persian into the conquered areas, notably Anatolia and Central and South Asia. Secondly, the influx of massive Turkish-speaking populations (culminating with the rank and file of the Mongol armies) and their settlement in large areas of Iran (particularly in Azerbaijan and the northwest), progressively turkicized local speakers of Persian, Kurdish and other Iranian languages.”(John Perry. Iran & the Caucasus, Vol. 5, (2001), pp. 193-200. THE HISTORICAL ROLE OF TURKISH IN RELATION TO PERSIAN OF IRAN)</ref>

The dynasty was founded by [[Sebük Tigin|Sebuktigin]] upon his succession to rule of territories centered around the city of [[Ghazna|Ghazni]] from his father-in-law, [[Alp Tigin]], a break-away ex-general of the Samanid sultans.<ref name="EB">Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Ghaznavid Dynasty'', Online Edition 2007 ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036676/Ghaznavid-Dynasty LINK])</ref>  Sebuktigin's son, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Shah Mahmoud]], expanded the empire in the region that stretched from the [[Oxus river]] to the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]; and in the west it reached [[Rayy]] and [[Hamadan]]. Under the reign of [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni|Mas'ud I]] it experienced major territorial losses. It lost its western territories to the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuqs]] in the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] resulting in a restriction of its holdings to [[Afghanistan]], [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. In 1151, Sultan Bahram Shah lost Ghazni to Ala'uddin Hussain of [[Ghurids|Ghor]] and the capital was moved to [[Lahore]] until its subsequent capture by the [[Ghurids]] in 1186. 

==Rise to power==

Two military families arose from the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] Slave-Guards of the [[Samanids]] — the Simjurids and Ghaznavids — who ultimately proved disastrous to the Samanids. The [[Simjurids]] received an appanage in the [[Kohistan District, Afghanistan|Kohistan]] region of eastern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. [[Alptigin|Alp Tigin]] founded the Ghaznavid fortunes when he established himself at Ghazna (modern [[Ghazni]], [[Afghanistan]]) in 962. He and [[Abu al-Hasan Simjuri]], as [[Samanid]] generals, competed with each other for the governorship of [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and control of the Samanid empire by placing on the throne [[emir]]s they could dominate when [[Abdul Malik I of Samanid]] died in 961. But when the [[Samanid]] Emir [[Abdul Malik I of Samanid|Abdul Malik I]] died in 961 CE it created a succession crisis between Abdul Malik's  brothers. A court party instigated by men of the scribal class—civilian ministers as contrasted with Turkic generals—rejected Alp Tigin's candidate for the Samanid throne. [[Mansur I of Samanid|Mansur I]] was installed, and Alp Tigin prudently retired to his fief of Ghazna. The Simjurids enjoyed control of Khorasan south of the [[Oxus]] but were hard-pressed by a third great Iranian dynasty, the [[Buwayhid]]s, and were unable to survive the collapse of the Samanids and the rise of the Ghaznavids. 

The struggles of the Turkic slave generals for mastery of the throne with the help of shifting allegiance from the court's ministerial leaders both demonstrated and accelerated the Samanid decline. Samanid weakness attracted into [[Transoxania]] the [[Qarluq]] [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], who had recently converted to Islam. They occupied Bukhara in 992 to establish in Transoxania the [[Qarakhanid]], or Ilek Khanid, dynasty. Alp Tigin had been succeeded at Ghazna by Sebüktigin (died 997). [[Sabuktigin|Sebüktigin]]'s son [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]] made an agreement with the Qarakhanids whereby the Oxus was recognized as their mutual boundary.

==Domination==
[[Sebük Tigin|Saboktekin]] made himself lord of nearly all the present territory of [[Afghanistan]] and of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] by conquest of [[Samanid]] and [[Shahi]] lands. In 997, [[Mahmud of Ghaznavid|Mahmud]], the son of Sebük Tigin, succeeded his father upon his death, and with him Ghazni and the Ghaznavid dynasty have become perpetually associated. He completed the conquest of [[Samanid]], [[Shahi]] lands, the [[Ismaili]] Kingdom of [[Multan]], [[Sindh]] as well as some Buwayhid territory. Under him all accounts was the golden age and the height of the Ghaznevid Empire. Mahmud carried out seventeen expeditions through northern [[India]] establishing his control and setting up tributary states. His raids also resulted in the looting of a great deal of plunder. From the borders of [[Kurdistan]] to [[Samarkand]], from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Yamuna]], he established his authority.

The wealth brought back from the Indian expeditions to Ghazni was enormous, and contemporary historians (e.g. [[Abolfazl Beyhaghi]], [[Ferdowsi]]) give glowing descriptions of the magnificence of the capital, as well as of the conquerors munificent support of literature. Mahmud died in (1030).  Even though there was some revival of importance under Ibrahim (1059-1099), the empire never reached anything like the same splendor and power. It was soon overshadowed by the [[Seljuqs]] of [[Iran]].

==Decline==
[[File:MassudOfGhazniCoin.jpg|thumb|left|Coinage of [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]], derived from [[Shahi]] designs, with the name of Mas'ud in Arabic.]]
Mahmud's son [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni|Mas'ud]] was unable to preserve the empire and following a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] in (1040) lost all the Ghaznavid lands in [[Iran]] and [[Central Asia]] to the Seljuks and plunged the realm into a "Time of troubles".<ref name="EB"/><ref name="Iranica">Encyclopedia Iranica, ''Ghaznavids'', Edmund Bosworth, Online Edition 2007, ([http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v10f6/v10f608.html LINK])</ref> Mas'ud's son Ibrahim who re-established a truncated empire on a firmer basis by arriving at a peace agreement with the Seljuks and a restoration of cultural and political linkages.<ref name="Iranica"/> Under Ibrahim and his successors saw a period of sustained tranquility for the empire. Shorn of its western land it was increasingly sustained by riches accrued from raids across Northern India where it faced stiff resistance from [[Rajput]] rulers such as the [[Paramara]] of [[Malwa]] and the [[Gahadvala]] of [[Kannauj]].<ref name="Iranica"/> Signs of weakness in the state became apparent when Masud III died in 1115 with internal strife between his sons ending with the ascension of Sultan Bahram Shah as a Seljuk Vassal.<ref name="Iranica"/> Sultan Bahram Shah, was the last Ghaznavid King ruling [[Ghazna|Ghazni]], the first and main Ghaznavid capital. Ala'uddin Hussain, a [[Ghorid]] King, conquered the city of Ghazni in 1151, for the revenge of his brother's death. He razed all the city, and burned it for 7 days, after which he got famous as ''"Jahānsoz"'' (''World Burner''). Ghazni was restored to the Ghaznavids by the intervention of the Seljuks who came to Behrams aid.<ref name="Iranica"/> Ghaznavid struggles with the Ghurids continued in the subsequent years as they nibbled away at Ghaznavid territory and Ghazni and [[Zabulistan]] was lost a group of [[Oghuz]] Turks before captured by the Gurids.<ref name="Iranica"/> Ghaznavid power in northern [[India]] continued until the conquest of [[Lahore]] from Khusrau Malik in 1186.<ref name="Iranica"/>

==Legacy==
[[File:Carafe Iran.JPG|thumb|left|100px|Ghaznavid era art: Free-blown, wheel-cut [[carafe]]s. First half of 11th century. Excavated at ''Teppe Madraseh'', [[Nishapur]], [[Iran]]. New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.]]
The Ghaznavid empire grew to cover much of present-day [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and northwest [[India]], and the Ghaznavids are generally credited with launching Islam into [[Hindu]]-dominated India. In addition to the wealth accumulated through raiding Indian cities, and exacting tribute from Indian [[Raja]]s the Ghaznavids also benefited from their position as an intermediary along the trade routes between [[China]] and the [[Mediterranean]]. They were however unable to hold power for long and by 1040 the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]]s had taken over their [[Persian Empire|Persian]] domains and a century later the [[Ghurids]] took over their remaining sub-continental lands.

==Culture==
Although the Ghaznavids were of Turkic origin and their military leaders were generally of the same stock, as a result of the original involvement of [[Sebük Tigin|Sebuktigin]] and [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud]] in Samanid affairs and in the Samanid cultural environment, the dynasty became thoroughly Persianized, so that in practice one cannot consider their rule over Iran one of foreign domination. In terms of cultural championship and the support of Persian poets, they were far more Persian than the ethnically Iranian [[Buyids]] rivals, whose support of Arabic letters in preference to Persian is well known.<ref name="Iranica2">Encyclopedia Iranica, ''Iran'', EHSAN YARSHATER, Online Edition 2008, ([http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v13f3/v13f3001b.html])</ref>

In fact with the adoption of Persian administrative and cultural ways the Ghaznavids threw off their original Turkish steppe background and became largely integrated with the ''Perso-Islamic tradition''.<ref>Clifford Edmund Bosworth, ''The new Islamic dynasties: a chronological and genealogical manual'', Edition: 2, Published by Edinburgh University Press, 2004, ISBN 0748621377, p. 297</ref>
