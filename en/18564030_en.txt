A '''metropolis''' is a big [[city]], in most cases with over half a million inhabitants in the city proper, and with a population of at least one million living in its [[Agglomeration|urban agglomeration]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Big cities belonging to a larger urban agglomeration, but which are not the core of that agglomeration, are not generally considered a metropolis but a part of it. A metropolis is usually a significant [[economical]], [[political]] and [[cultural]] center for some [[country]] or [[region]], and an important hub for regional or international connections and communications. The plural of the word is most commonly ''metropolises'', though ''metropoleis'' is sometimes used as well.

In a broader sense, it refers to the city or state of origin of a [[colony]] (as of [[ancient Greece]]), a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or a large important city.

== Antiquity ==

In the past, ''metropolis'' was the designation for a city or state of origin of a [[colony]]. Many large cities founded by ancient civilizations have been considered important world metropolises of their times due to their large populations and importance. Examples include [[Alexandria]], [[Angkor]], [[Antioch]], [[Athens]], [[Babylon]], [[Baghdad]], [[Beirut]], [[Benares]], [[Byblos]], [[Cahokia]], [[Carthage]], [[Constantinople]], [[Corinth]], [[Damascus]], [[Dholavira]], [[Ephesus]], [[Great Zimbabwe]], [[Harappa]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Leptis Magna]], [[Nanjing]], [[Nineveh]], [[Macchu Picchu]], [[Mohenjo-Daro]], [[Rome]], [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]], [[Side]], [[Siracuse]], [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Teotihuacan]], [[Tikal]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Xian]] and [[Ur]]. Some of these ancient metropolises survived until the modern days and are among the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|world's oldest continuously inhabited cities]].

== Etymology and modern usage ==

The word comes from the Greek μήτηρ, ''mētēr'' meaning "mother" and πόλις, ''pólis'' meaning "city"/"town", which is how the [[Greek colonies]] of antiquity referred to their original cities, with whom they retained cultic and political-cultural connections. The word was used in post-classical Latin for the chief city of a province, the seat of the government and, in particular, ecclesiastically for the seat or see of a [[metropolitan bishop]] to whom [[suffragan bishop]]s were responsible. This usage equates the province with the [[diocese]] or [[episcopal see]].

In modern usage the word is also used for a [[metropolitan area]], a set of adjacent and interconnected [[cities]] clustered around a major urban center. In this sense ''metropolitan'' usually means "spanning the whole metropolis" (as in "metropolitan administration"); or "proper of a metropolis" (as in "metropolitan life", and opposed to "[[Province|provincial]]" or "rural").

== Global cities ==

The concept of a [[Global city]] (or a World city) means a city that has a direct and tangible effect on global affairs through socioeconomic means. The term has become increasingly familiar, because of the rise of [[globalization]] (i.e., [[global finance]], [[communication]]s, and [[travel]]). An attempt to define and categorize world cities by financial criteria was made by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group & Network (GaWC), based primarily at [[Loughborough University]] in England. The study ranked cities based on their provision of "advanced producer services" such as [[accountancy]], [[advertising]], [[finance]] and [[law]]. The Inventory identifies three levels of world cities and several sub-ranks (''see [[Global city#GaWC Inventory of World Cities|World cities ranking]]'').

A metropolis is not necessarily a global city—or, being one, it could not be among the top-ranking—due to its standards of living, development, and infrastructures.

== Local definitions by country ==
=== Canada ===

[[Statistics Canada]] defines a [[census metropolitan area]] as one or more adjacent municipalities situated around a major urban core where the urban core has a population of at least 100,000.<ref>[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/reference/dict/geo009.htm Geographic Units: Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) and Census Agglomeration (CA)]</ref>

=== India ===

In the Republic of India, the Census Commission defines a metropolitan city as one having a population of over 40 lakh (4 million).<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/04/07/stories/0207000q.htm Ahmedabad yet to become mega city]</ref> [[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]], [[Chennai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Bangalore]], [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], and [[Ahmedabad]] are the seven cities that qualify. Residents of these cities are also entitled to a higher house-rent allowance. The figure only applies to the city region and not the conurbation.

=== Italy ===

With the 2001 reform of the Title V of the Constitution of Italy, the Italian republic has provided for the institution of ''Aree Metropolitane''. ''Aree Metropolitane'' will be instituted at least for the major conurbations of [[Rome]] and [[Milan]], but, {{As of|2009|January|lc=on}}, it is yet unclear whether the ''Aree Metropolitane'' will replace Provinces, or just be added to the older administrative subdivisions.

=== Japan ===

The Japanese legal term ''to'' (都) is commonly translated as "metropolis".<ref>{{cite web

=== United Kingdom ===

Various [[conurbation]]s in the United Kingdom are considered to be metropolitan areas (see [[Metropolitan county]]). The term ''Metropolis'' itself is rarely used. [[London]] is archaically referred to as "the Metropolis", which is only retained by the London police force, the [[Metropolitan Police Service]].

=== United States ===

In the United States an [[Incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] area or group of areas having a population more than 50,000 is required to have a [[metropolitan planning organization]] in order to facilitate major infrastructure projects and to ensure financial solubility. Thus, a population of 50,000 or greater has been used as a [[de facto]] standard in the United States to define a metropolis. A similar definition is used by the [[United States Census Bureau]]. They define a [[Metropolitan Statistical Area|metropolitan statistical area]] as ''at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more inhabitants''.

== Metropolis as a mainland area ==

{{Main|Metropole}}

In France, Portugal and Spain, ''metropolis'' (''métropole'' (Fr.) / ''metrópole'' (Port.) / ''metrópoli'' (Spa.)) designates the mainland part of a country near or on the European continent; in the case of France, this would mean France without its [[Département d'outre-mer|overseas departments]]; for Portugal and Spain during the [[Spanish Empire]] and [[Portuguese Empire]] period, it used to be common to designate Portugal or Spain except its colonies (the ''Ultramar''). In France ''metropolis'' is also used to refer to large agglomerations.
