[[Image:Cattle Egret I IMG 8919.jpg|thumb|Breeding plumage adult ''B. i. coromandus'']]
The '''Cattle Egret''' (''Bubulcus ibis'') is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] species of [[heron]] ([[family (biology)|family]] [[heron|Ardeidae]]) found in the tropics, subtropics and warm temperate zones. It is the only member of the [[monotype (biology)|monotypic]] genus '''''Bubulcus''''', although some authorities regard its  two subspecies as full species. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus ''[[Egretta]]'', it is more closely related to the herons of ''[[Ardea (genus)|Ardea]]''. Originally native to parts of [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Europe]], it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully [[Colonisation (biology)|colonised]] much of the rest of the world.

It is a stocky white [[bird]] adorned with buff [[feather|plumes]] in the breeding season which nests in [[bird colony|colonies]], usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The [[bird nest|nest]] is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Unlike most other herons, it feeds in relatively dry grassy habitats, often [[Commensalism|accompanying]] cattle or other large mammals, since it catches insect and small [[vertebrate]] prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the Cattle Egret are [[bird migration|migratory]] and  others show post-breeding dispersal. 

The adult Cattle Egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks may be lost to starvation, calcium deficiency or disturbance from other large birds. This species removes ticks and flies from cattle, but it can be a [[Bird strike|safety hazard]] at airfields, and has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.

The Cattle Egret was first described in 1758 by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Systema naturae]]'' as ''Ardea ibis'',<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C. | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

==Description==

The Cattle Egret is a stocky heron with a 88&ndash;96&nbsp;cm (35&ndash;38&nbsp;in) wingspan; it is 46&ndash;56&nbsp;centimetres (18&ndash;22&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) in length and weighs 270&ndash;512&nbsp;[[gram]]s (9.5&ndash;18.1&nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]).<ref name= Cornell/> It has a relatively short thick neck, sturdy bill, and a hunched posture. The non-breeding adult has  mainly white plumage, a yellow bill and greyish-yellow legs. During the breeding season, adults of the nominate western subspecies develop orange-buff plumes on the  back, breast and crown, and the bill, legs and [[iris (anatomy)|irises]] become bright red for a brief period prior to pairing.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Krebs|first=E.

''B. i. coromandus'' differs from the nominate subspecies in breeding plumage,  when the  buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] are longer on average than in ''B. i. ibis''.<ref name =CITES>{{cite web|title= ''Bubulcus ibis'' (Linnaeus, 1758) |work= Appendix 3 |author = Biber, Jean-Pierre |url= http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/ID/fauna/Volume2/A-211.001.005.004%20Bubulcus%20ibis_E.pdf |format =PDF|publisher= [[CITES]]|accessdate=2008-03-16}}</ref> ''B. i. seychellarum'' is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Cattle Egret I2m IMG 5478.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Typical grassland habitat in [[Kolkata]]]]

The species first arrived in North America in 1941 (these early sightings were originally dismissed as escapees), bred in Florida in 1953, and spread rapidly, breeding for the first time in Canada in 1962.<ref name = "HBW"/> It is now commonly seen as far west as California. It was first recorded breeding in [[Cuba]] in 1957, in [[Costa Rica]] in 1958, and in [[Mexico]] in 1963, although it was probably established before that.<ref name=Crosby/> In Europe the species had historically declined in Spain and Portugal, but in the latter part of the 20th century it expanded back through the Iberian Peninsula, and then began to colonise other parts of Europe; southern France in 1958, northern France in 1981 and Italy in 1985.<ref name = "HBW"/> Breeding in the [[United Kingdom]] was recorded for the first time in 2008 only a year after an influx seen in the previous year.<ref name = BBC>{{cite web|title=First cattle egrets breed in UK |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/7521476.stm |work = BBC News|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal[British Birds|volume=101|issue=2|year=2008|page=108|title=Recent reports |first=Barry|last=Nightingale|coauthor=Eric Dempsey|url=http://www.britishbirds.co.uk/BB%20February%202008.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> In 2008 cattle egrets were also reported as having moved into Ireland for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/flying-in----to-make-new-friends-down-on-the-farm-1266360.html |title=Flying in to make new friends|work=[[Irish Independent]], 15-Jan-2008}}</ref>

The massive and rapid expansion of the Cattle Egret's range is due to its relationship with humans and their domesticated animals. Originally adapted to a [[Commensalism|commensal]] relationship with large browsing animals, it was easily able to switch to domesticated cattle and horses. As livestock keeping spread throughout the world it was able to occupy otherwise empty [[niche]]s.<!--, and one which in intensive agriculture was superior to its natural one !!something wrong with the connection!! --><ref>{{cite journal|last=Botkin|first=D. B.|year=2001|title=The naturalness of biological invasions|journal=Western North American Naturalist|volume=61|issue=3|pages=261–266}}</ref>
Many populations of Cattle Egrets are highly [[bird migration|migratory]] and dispersive,<ref name = "BNA"/> and this has helped the species' range expansion. The species has been seen as a vagrant in various sub-Antarctic islands, including [[South Georgia]], [[Marion Island]], the [[South Sandwich Islands]] and the [[South Orkney Islands]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Silva|first=M. P.|coauthors=Coria, N. E.;Favero, M.; Casaux, R.

In addition to the natural expansion of its range, Cattle Egrets have been [[introduced species|introduced]] into a few areas. The species was introduced to [[Hawaii]] in 1959, and to the [[Chagos Archipelago]] in 1955. Successful releases were also made in the [[Seychelles]] and [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]], but attempts to introduce the species to Mauritius failed. Numerous birds were also released by [[Whipsnade Zoo]] in England, but the species never established.<ref name = "Lever">{{cite book|last=Lever|first=C.|year=1987|title=Naturalised Birds of the World|publisher=Longman Scientific & Technical; Harlow, Essex.|isbn=ISBN 0-582-46055-7|pages=15&ndash;17}}</ref>  

Although the Cattle Egret sometimes feeds in shallow water, unlike most herons it is  typically  found in fields and dry grassy habitats, reflecting its greater dietary reliance on terrestrial insects rather than aquatic prey.<ref name="Collins">{{cite book|last=Mullarney|first=Killian|coauthors=Svensson, Lars; Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter|year=2001|title=Birds of Europe|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691050546}}</ref>
===Migration and movements===
Some populations of Cattle Egrets are [[bird migration|migratory]], others are dispersive, and distinguishing between the two can be difficult for this species.<ref name = "BNA"/> In many areas populations can be both [[sedentary]] and migratory. In the northern hemisphere migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but Cattle Egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler [[Tasmania]] and New Zealand in the winter and return in the spring.<ref name = "Maddock"/> Migration in western Africa is in response to rainfall, and in South America migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the non breeding season.<ref name = "BNA"/> Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the [[monsoon]]s. They move north from Kerala after September.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seedikkoya|first=K.|coauthors= Azeez, P. A.; Shukkur, E. A.

Young birds are known to disperse up to 5,000&nbsp;km (3,100&nbsp;mi) from their breeding area. Flocks may fly vast distances and have been seen over seas and oceans including in the middle of the Atlantic.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arendt|first=Wayne J.|year=1988|title=Range Expansion of the Cattle Egret (''Bubulcus ibis'') in the Greater Caribbean Basin|journal=Colonial Waterbirds|volume=11|issue=2|pages=252&ndash;262|doi=10.2307/1521007}}</ref>

===Status===
This species has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10&nbsp;million square kilometres (3.8&nbsp;square miles). Its global population estimated to be 3.8–6.7&nbsp;million individuals. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.<ref name =IUCN/> On the other hand the expansion and establishment of the species over large ranges has led it to be classed as an [[invasive species]] (although little, if any impact has been noted yet).<ref name = GISS>{{cite web|title= ''Bubulcus ibis'' (bird) |work= Global Invasive Species Database|url= http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=970&fr=1&sts=sss&lang=EN|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref>

The Cattle Egret nests in [[Bird colony|colonies]], which are often, but not always, found around bodies of water.<ref name="BNA"/> The colonies are usually found in woodlands near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as [[heron]]s, [[egret]]s, [[ibis]]es and [[cormorant]]s.

The dominant factor in nesting mortality is starvation.

A Cattle Egret will weakly defend the area around a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and continue foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, Cattle Egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15&nbsp;steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, Cattle Egrets selectively foraged behind [[Plains Zebra]]s, [[Waterbuck]], [[Blue Wildebeest]] and [[Cape Buffalo]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burger|first=J.|coauthors=Gochfeld, M. |year=1993|title=Making Foraging Decisions: Host Selection by Cattle Egrets ''Bubulcus ibis''|journal=Ornis Scandinavica|volume=24|issue=3|pages=229&ndash;236|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0030-5693%28199307%2F09%2924%3A3%3C229%3AMFDHSB%3E2.0.CO%3B2-H|doi=10.2307/3676738}}</ref> Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.<ref name=NMcKilligan/>

The Cattle Egret may also show versatility in its diet.

==Relationship with humans==
A conspicuous species, the Cattle Egret has attracted many common names. These mostly relate to its habit of following cattle and other large animals, and it is known variously as cow crane, cow bird or cow heron, or even  elephant bird, rhinoceros egret.<ref name ="BNA"/> Its [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name, ''abu qerdan'', means “father of ticks", a name derived from the huge number of parasites such as avian ticks found in its breeding colonies.<ref name ="BNA"/><ref name=WLM >{{cite journal|last=McAtee |first= Waldo Lee |month=  October |year= 1925 |title=[http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v042n04/p0603-p0604.pdf The Buff-backed Egret (''Ardea ibis'' L., Arabic ''Abu Qerdan'') as a Factor in Egyptian Agriculture] |journal=The Auk  |volume=42 |issue= 4 |pages=603&ndash;604 |format =PDF}}</ref>

The Cattle Egret is a popular bird with cattle [[rancher]]s for its perceived role as a [[biocontrol]] of cattle [[parasite]]s such as [[tick]]s and [[fly|flies]].<ref name ="BNA"/> A study in Australia found that Cattle Egrets reduced the number of flies that bothered cattle by pecking them directly off the skin.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKilligan|first=N.

Not all interactions between humans and Cattle Egrets are beneficial. The Cattle Egret can be a potential safety hazard due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paton|first=P.|coauthors=Fellows, D.; Tomich, P. |year=1986|title=Distribution of Cattle Egret Roosts in Hawaii With Notes on the Problems Egrets Pose to Airports|journal=Elepaio|volume=46|issue=13|pages=143&ndash;147}}</ref> and  it has been implicated in the spread of animal infections such as [[heartwater]], [[infectious bursal disease]]<ref>{{cite journal|journal=African Journal of Biomedical Research|volume=3|issue=3|year=2000|paegs=191-192|title=Serological survey of infectious bursal disease virus antibodies in cattle egrest, pigeons and Nigerian laughing doves|author=Fagbohun O.A., Owoade A.A., Oluwayelu D.O. & F.O.
