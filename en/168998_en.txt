'''Lake Winnipeg''' is a very large ({{km2 to sq mi|24514|abbr=on|precision=0}}) [[lake]] in central [[North America]], in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], about {{km to mi|55|spell=UK}} north of the city of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]].  It is the largest lake within the borders of southern Canada, and it is part of the most undeveloped and pristine large watershed of southern Canada.

It is the sixth-largest freshwater lake in Canada,<ref>[http://www.greatcanadianlakes.com/gc_lakes/Canada/index.htm Great Canadian Lakes]</ref> but it is relatively shallow (mean depth of {{convert|12|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}<ref>[http://www.ilec.or.jp/database/nam/nam-08.html International Lake Environment Committee]</ref> excluding a narrow {{convert|36|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep channel between the northern and southern basins. It is the eleventh-largest freshwater lake on Earth. The east side of the lake has pristine boreal forests and rivers that are being promoted as a potential [[United Nations World Heritage Park]]. The lake is elongated in shape and is {{convert|416|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from north to south, with remote sandy beaches, large limestone cliffs, and many bat caves in some areas. [[Manitoba Hydro]] uses the lake as one of the largest reservoirs in the world. There are many islands in the lake and most are undeveloped and pristine. 

== Watershed ==
The lake's [[drainage basin|watershed]] measures about {{km2 to sq mi|984200|spell=UK}}, and covers much of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], northwestern [[Ontario]], [[Minnesota]], and [[North Dakota]]. Some of its tributaries include:

*[[Saskatchewan River]] (through [[Cedar Lake (Manitoba)|Cedar Lake]])
*[[Red River of the North|Red River]] (including [[Assiniboine River]])
*[[Winnipeg River]] (draining [[Lake of the Woods]], [[Rainy River (Minnesota-Ontario)|Rainy River]] and [[Rainy Lake]])
*[[Dauphin River]], (draining [[Lake Manitoba]] and [[Lake Winnipegosis]])
*[[Bloodvein River]] (on the East side, draining from the [[Canadian Shield]])
*[[Poplar River (Manitoba)|Poplar River]]
*[[Manigotagan River]]

Lake Winnipeg drains northward into the [[Nelson River]] at an average annual rate of 2,066 cubic metres per second (72,960&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft/s), and forms part of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed, which is one of the largest in the world. This watershed area was historically known as [[Rupert's Land]] when the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] was [[Royal Charter|chartered in 1670]].

== History ==
[[Image:Hbc post Lake Winnipeg.jpg|thumb|200pxpx|left|A Hudson's Bay Company post on Lake Winnipeg, circa 1884]]

Lake Winnipeg and [[Lake Manitoba]] are remnants of prehistoric [[Lake Agassiz|Glacial Lake Agassiz]]. The area between the lakes is called the Interlake Region, and the whole region is called the Manitoba Lowlands.

It is believed that [[Henry Kelsey]] was the first European to see the lake in 1690. He adopted the [[Cree language]] name for the lake: ''wīnipēk'' (ᐐᓂᐯᐠ), meaning "muddy waters". [[La Verendrye]] referred to the lake as ''Ouinipigon'' when he built the first forts in the area in the 1730s. Later, the [[Red River Colony]] to its south took the lake's name for [[Winnipeg]], the capital of Manitoba.

Lake Winnipeg lies along one of the oldest trading routes in [[North America]] to have flown the [[British flag]].  For several centuries, furs were traded along this route between [[York Factory]] on [[Hudson Bay]] (which was the longtime headquarters for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]) over Lake Winnipeg and the [[Red River Trails]] to the headwaters of the [[Mississippi River]] at [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. This was a strategic trading route for the [[First British Empire]]. With the establishment of the [[Second British Empire]] that occurred after Britain's loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]], a quite significant increase in trade occurred over Lake Winnipeg between [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[United States]].

== Water conditions ==

[[Image:Winnipeg-beach-MCB.jpg|right|thumb|[[Winnipeg Beach]], [[Manitoba]]]]
Because of its long, narrow shape, the lake exhibits a variety of interesting [[wind]] and wave effects, including waves of up to one metre in height at its southern shore, a process called [[seiche]]. This occurs when prevailing northerly winds blow along the length of Lake Winnipeg, exerting a horizontal stress on its surface. Surface waters move in the direction of the wind and pile up along the leeward south shores.

Furthermore, water depths are known to be extremely variable at the south end of the lake. Many of the recreational beaches on the southern end of the lake feature rustic, seasonal piers for swimmers.  It is not uncommon to be able to walk off the end of one of these piers one day into more than waist-deep water, then return a few days later to the same spot to find the water only ankle deep, or even exposed sand.

Setups greater than 1 m above normal lake levels have been recorded along many of southern Lake Winnipeg's recreational beaches, and the associated high waves with their uprush effects have caused considerable storm damage, backshore [[flood]] and shoreline [[erosion]]. The highest setups occur in the fall, when the northerly winds are strongest.

== Algae population and pollution ==
Lake Winnipeg is suffering from many environmental issues such as an explosion in the population of algae, caused by excessive amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus seeping into the lake.<ref>[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/11m-for-lake-winnipeg-49170002.html $1.1M for Lake Winnipeg - Winnipeg Free Press]</ref><ref>[http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/08/20/canada%e2%80%99s-sickest-lake Canada’s sickest lake],  MacLean's Magazine</ref>

== Communities ==
[[Image:Gimli harbour.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Gimli, Manitoba]]]]
[[File:Downtownwpgbeach.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba|Winnipeg Beach]] in October.]]

Communities on the lake include [[Grand Beach (Manitoba)|Grand Beach]], [[Riverton, Manitoba|Riverton]], [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], [[Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba|Winnipeg Beach]], [[Victoria Beach, Manitoba|Victoria Beach]], [[Pine Falls, Manitoba|Pine Falls]], [[Manigotagan, Manitoba|Manigotagan]], [[Berens River, Manitoba|Berens River]], Bloodvein, and [[Grand Rapids, Manitoba|Grand Rapids]]. A number of pleasure beaches are found on the southern end of the lake, which are popular in the summer, attracting many visitors from Winnipeg, about 80&nbsp;km south.

== Fishing ==

Lake Winnipeg has important commercial fisheries. Its catch makes up a major part of Manitoba's $30 million-a-year fishing industry.<ref>[http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/fish/ Manitoba Water Stewardship - Fisheries]</ref>

== Transportation ==

Because of its length the Lake Winnipeg water system and the lake itself was an important transportation route in the province before the railways reached Manitoba. It continued to be a major transportation route even after the railways reached the province. In addition to Indian canoes and [[York boat]]s, several steamboats plied the lake, including ''[[SS Anson Northup|Anson Northup]]'', ''[[SS City of Selkirk|City of Selkirk]]'', ''[[SS Colvile|Colvile]]'', ''[[SS Keenora|Keenora]]'', ''[[SS Premier|Premier]]'', ''[[SS Princess|Princess]]'', ''[[SS Winnitoba|Winnitoba]]'' and ''[[SS Wolverine|Wolverine]]''.
