'''Stewart Grand Prix''' is a former [[Formula One]] constructor and racing team. The team was formed by three times [[Formula One]] champion [[Jackie Stewart]] and his son [[Paul Stewart (driver)|Paul Stewart]] in 1996. The team competed in F1, as the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] works-supported team, for only three seasons, from 1997 to 1999. The 1999 season was by far its strongest, yielding one win ([[Johnny Herbert]] at the [[1999 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]]) and one pole position ([[Rubens Barrichello]] at the [[1999 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]]).

At the end of 1999, Ford bought the team outright and it was renamed [[Jaguar Racing]]. In 2004 [[Jaguar Racing]] was sold to energy drink company [[Red Bull]] and it became [[Red Bull Racing]].

==Origins==
Although the new team was formed from scratch, a considerable amount of previous experience went into it. Three times world champion Jackie Stewart had both a wealth of experience in Formula One and excellent connections high up in the Ford Motor Company that helped the new team gain the works engine deal for its first season. Paul Stewart had a moderately successful driving career in Formula 3000 and lower categories and had experience in running Paul Stewart Racing, which by the time the Formula One team was created was a well established and respected outfit in [[Formula Three]] and [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]].

While in late 1995, Stewart Racing (like top competitor [[DAMS]]) expressed disinterest in moving up to F1<ref name="Dec95">[http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00384.html F1 News > Pacific closing down<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, considering short-lived entries [[Simtek]], [[Pacific Racing|Pacific]] and [[Forti]] either had folded or looked to fold<ref name="Dec95" />, this decision was reversed in January 1996 when Jackie Stewart secured a five-year development deal with Ford to make it a [[wiktionary:factory team|factory team]].<ref name="jackie">[http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00421.html F1 News > Stewart gets Ford<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Ford had been in a deal as a factory engine supplier to Sauber before this<ref name="jackie" />.

===1997===
'''Stewart Grand Prix''' → [[Jaguar Racing]] → [[Red Bull Racing]]

With backing from [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], Stewart GP entered the 1997 [[Australian Grand Prix]] with drivers [[Rubens Barrichello]] and [[Jan Magnussen]]. The only success of their first year came at the rain-affected [[1997 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] where Barrichello finished an impressive second. Magnussen in the second car finished just outside the points in 7th after losing his front wing at the chicane.   Elsewhere, the cars were consistent midfield runners and Barrichello was often in a position to challenge for points.  Overall, it was an impressive first season from Stewart in terms of competitiveness, as new teams often struggle badly with the pace of Formula One.  However, Stewart's reliability was poor, as the Ford Zetec-R V10 engine installed in the SF1 chassis proved to be extremely fragile.  This restricted the team to just eight classified finishes out of a possible thirty-four.

===1998===
1998 was a great struggle for the team, with neither driver able to step onto the podium. Indeed, points were hard to come by, and after a number of poor drives [[Jan Magnussen]] was replaced by Dutchman [[Jos Verstappen]], ironically the race after Magnussen scored his first and only Formula One points at the accident-laden [[1998 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]]. 

In the end the driver change did not seem to make a great difference as Jos also struggled with the car, but he did push Barrichello harder than Magnussen {{Fact|date=September 2008}}. Verstappen left the team at the end of the season after [[Johnny Herbert]] joined but was less than happy with the set up of Stewart and blasted it for its favoritism to Barrichello and accused it of being unable to run more than one car {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

At the end of the 1998 season, technical director Alan Jenkins left Stewart Grand Prix, and was replaced by [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan's]] [[Gary Anderson (Formula One Designer)|Gary Anderson]]<ref>http://fidonet.sensationcontent.com/echomail/grand-prix/ff3c687c95f8716f.html</ref> .

===1999===

[[File:Johnny Herbert 1999 Canada.jpg|thumb|right|[[Johnny Herbert]] took Stewart's first and only F1 win in {{F1|1999}}.]]

After [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] acquired [[Cosworth]] in July 1998, they risked designing and building a brand-new engine for 1999. It paid off. The SF3 was quick out of the box, however embarrassingly for Ford both cars over-heated on the grid of the first race, the Australian Grand Prix, after qualifying competitively. This put Herbert out instantly and made Barrichello start from the pit lane. Barrichello drove an excellent race and was unfortunate not to win, as all the cars who were ahead of him on the grid failed to finish the race. Had he not started from the pit lane and gained a stop-go penalty during the race it is likely that he would have finished considerably higher than in 5th place. The car was consistently competitive throughout the season, however the engine initially proved fragile as both cars blew their engines at the Brazilian race which meant the engine was rarely run at full power. Stewart's competitiveness was affirmed by running first in Brazil for a long spell of the race and qualifying on pole for the French Grand Prix with Barrichello. [[Johnny Herbert]] inherited a popular victory at the rain soaked [[European Grand Prix]] at the new [[Nürburgring]] after other leading contenders crashed off the track or lost time in the pits changing tyres<ref>''1999 European Grand Prix Race Report'' [http://www.sportinglife.com/formula1/reports/story_get.dor?STORY_NAME=others/99/09/26/manual_171313.html www.sportinglife.com] Retrieved 11 May 2006</ref>. Barrichello finished third, in a result most observers indicated that Stewart deserved given their strength over the season. Johnny Herbert also became unwittingly influential in the championship at the next and penultimate race, the Malaysian Grand Prix. Running 3rd behind the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]s of [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Eddie Irvine]], a mistake in the closing laps allowed [[Mika Häkkinen]] to slip past and claim the final podium position which gave the championship contender vital points. The Ferraris were disqualified for car irregularities and the win allowed Häkkinen to gain his second championship. The Stewarts as a result finished 2nd and 3rd in the race. However Ferrari won an appeal and the initial result was reinstated. Häkkinen however went on to win the championship and Stewart came 4th in the Constructors Championship beating illustrious teams such as [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] and [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]]. Stewart's last race was the [[1999 Japanese Grand Prix]].

After [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] increased its commitment by buying the team out, it became known as [[Jaguar Racing]] for the 2000 season. Poor results however, led to the team being sold for the 2005 season, becoming [[Red Bull Racing]].
