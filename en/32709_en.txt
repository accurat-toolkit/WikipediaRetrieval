'''VTOL''' is an abbreviation for '''Vertical Take-Off and Landing''' [[aircraft]]. See also [[V/STOL]]. This classification includes [[fixed-wing aircraft]] that can hover, take off and land vertically as well as [[helicopter]]s and other aircraft with powered rotors, such as [[tiltrotor]]s.<ref>"Vertical Takeoff & Landing Aircraft," John P. Campbell, The MacMillan Company, New York, 1962. </ref><ref>"VTOL – Military Research Aircraft," Mike Rogers, Orion Books, New York, 1989.</ref><ref>"Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Aircraft," edited by I.B. Laskowitz, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, Vol 107, Art.1, March 25, 1963.</ref><ref>"Straight Up - A History of Vertical Flight," Steve Markman and Bill Holder, Schiffer Publishing, 2000.</ref> [[Autogyro]]s, [[balloon]]s, [[airship]]s and [[rocket]]s are not normally considered VTOL, but may be termed VTVL (Vertical Takeoff with Vertical Landing).{{Fact|date=June 2009}} Some VTOL aircraft can operate in other modes as well, such as [[CTOL]] (Conventional Take-off and Landing), [[STOL]] (Short Take-Off and Landing), and/or [[STOVL]] (Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing) mode. Others, such as some helicopters, can only operate by VTOL, due to the aircraft lacking [[landing gear]] that can handle horizontal motion. VTOL is a subset of [[V/STOL]].

Besides the ubiquitous helicopter, there are currently two types of VTOL aircraft in military service: craft using a [[tiltrotor]], such as the [[Bell Helicopter Textron|Bell]] [[Boeing]] [[V-22 Osprey]], and aircraft using directed jet thrust such as the [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier]] family.

==History==

In addition to the [[helicopter]], many approaches have been tried to develop practical aircraft with vertical take-off and landing capabilities. An early contribution to VTOL was [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]]'s [[Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig|Thrust Measuring Rig]] ("flying bedstead") of 1953. This led to the first VTOL engines as used in the first British VTOL aircraft, the [[Short SC.1]] (1957) which used 4 vertical lift engines with a horizontal one for forward thrust.

The idea of using the same engine for vertical and horizontal flight by altering the path of the thrust led to the [[Bristol Siddeley Pegasus]] engine which used rotating ducts to direct thrust over a range of angles. This was developed side by side with an airframe, the [[Hawker P.1127]], which became subsequently the Kestrel and then entered production as the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]], though the supersonic [[Hawker Siddeley P.1154]] was canceled in 1965. The French in competition with the P.1154 had developed a version of the [[Dassault Mirage III]] capable of attaining [[Mach Number|Mach]] 1. The [[Dassault Mirage IIIV]] achieved transition from vertical to horizontal flight in March 1966, reaching Mach 1.3 in level flight a short time later.

The Harrier is often flown in [[STOVL]] mode which enables it to carry a higher fuel or weapon load over a given distance. Now retired from British [[Royal Navy]] service, the [[Indian Navy]] operates [[Sea Harrier]]s mainly from its [[aircraft carrier]] [[INS Viraat]]. The latest version of the Harrier, the [[BAE Harrier II]] is operated by the British [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]]. The United States Marine Corps, and the Italian and Spanish Navies use the [[AV-8 Harrier II]], an equivalent derivative of the Harrier II. The Harrier II/AV-8 will be replaced in the air arms of the US and UK by a STOVL variant of the [[F-35 Lightning II]].

[[NASA]] has flown other VTOL craft such as the [[Bell XV-15]] research craft (1977), as have the [[Soviet Navy]] and ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation|Sikorsky]] tested an aircraft dubbed the [[Sikorsky S-72|X-Wing]], which took off in the manner of a helicopter. The rotors would become stationary in mid-flight, and function as wings, providing lift in addition to the static wings. [[Boeing X-50]] is a [[Canard Rotor/Wing]] prototype that utilizes a similar concept.

The [[Yakovlev Yak-38]] was the [[Soviet Navy]]'s VTOL aircraft for their light carriers, cargoships, and capital ships. It was developed from the [[Yakovlev Yak-36]] experimental aircraft. Before the Soviet Union collapsed, a supersonic VTOL aircraft was developed as the Yak-38's successor, the [[Yakovlev Yak-141|Yak-141]], which never went into production.

In the 1960s and early 70s Germany planned three different VTOL planes. One used the [[F-104]] as a base for research for a [[V/STOL]] aircraft. Although two models (X1 and X2) were built, the project was canceled due to high costs and political problems as well as changed needs in the [[Luftwaffe]] and NATO. The [[EWR VJ 101]]C did perform free VTOL take-offs and landings, as well as test flights beyond mach 1 in the mid- and late 60s. One of the test-aircraft is preserved in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, Germany. The others were the VFW-Fokker [[VFW VAK 191B|VAK 191B]] light fighter and reconnaissance plane, and the [[Dornier Do 31]]E-3 (troop) transport.

===Canadair CL-84 Dynavert===

The [[Canadair CL-84|CL-84]] was a Canadian [[V/STOL]] turbine tilt-wing monoplane designed and manufactured by [[Canadair]] between 1964 and 1972. The Canadian government ordered three updated CL-84s for military evaluation in 1968, designated the CL-84-1. From 1972 to 1974, this version was demonstrated and evaluated in the United States aboard the aircraft carriers USS ''Guam'' and USS ''Guadalcanal'', and at various other centres. These trials involved military pilots from the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Two of the CL-84s crashed due to mechanical failures, but no loss of life occurred as a result of these accidents. No production contracts resulted.

Aircraft designed to operate in extraterrestrial environments often utilize VTOL. An example of this type of aircraft is the [[LLRV]]. [[Spacecraft]] typically operate in environments where runways or even a suitably flat surface for skids is nonexistent.

===V-22===

The [[V-22 Osprey]] is the world's first production [[tiltrotor]] aircraft, with one three-bladed [[proprotor]], [[turboprop]] engine, and transmission [[nacelle]] mounted on each wingtip. The Osprey is a multi-mission aircraft with both a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and short takeoff and landing capability ([[STOL]]). It is designed to perform missions like a conventional [[helicopter]] with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a [[turboprop]] aircraft. The FAA classifies the Osprey as a model of [[powered lift]] aircraft.
